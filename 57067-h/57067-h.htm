<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The adventures of our Pilgrim Fathers must ever
be a theme of absorbing interest to all their descendants.
Their persecutions in England, their flight to
Holland, their passage across the stormy ocean, this
new world, as they found it, swept by the storms of
approaching winter, their struggles with the hardships
of the wilderness, and conflicts with the ferocious
savage,—all combine in forming a narrative
replete with the elements of entertainment and instruction.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there can be no doubt in reference
to the essential facts. All these events have occurred
within the last three hundred years, a period
fully covered by authentic historical documents. In
giving occasional extracts from these documents, I
have deemed it expedient to modernize the spelling,
and occasionally to exchange an unintelligible, obsolete
word for one now in use.</p>

<p>For a period of about forty years, Captain Miles
Standish was intimately associated with the Pilgrims.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">ii</span>
His memory is inseparably connected with theirs.
It has been a constant pleasure to the author to
endeavor to rear a worthy tribute to the heroic
captain and the noble man, who was one of the
most illustrious of those who laid the foundations
of this great Republic.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, the maiden queen of England, commenced
her long and eventful reign by issuing in
May, 1659 a law concerning religion entitled the
“Act of Uniformity.” By this law all ministers were
prohibited from conducting public worship otherwise
than in accordance with minute directions for the
Church of England, issued by Parliament. Any one
who should violate this law was exposed to severe
penalties, and upon a third offence to imprisonment
for life.</p>

<p>England, having broken from the Church of
Rome, and having established the Church of England,
of which the queen was the head, Elizabeth and
her counsellors were determined, at whatever cost, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
enforce entire uniformity of doctrines and of modes
of worship. In their new organization they retained
many of the ceremonies and much of the imposing
display of the Papal Church. There were very many
of the clergy and of the laity who, displeased with
the pageantry of the Roman Catholic Church, with
its gilded robes and showy ceremonial, were resolved
to cherish a more simple and pure worship. They
earnestly appealed for the abolition of this oppressive
act. Their petition was refused by a majority of but
one in a vote of one hundred and seventeen in the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>The queen was unrelenting, and demanded uniformity
in the most peremptory terms. Thirty-seven
out of the ninety-eight ministers of London were arrested
for violating this law. They were all suspended
from their ministerial functions, and fourteen
of them were sent to jail.</p>

<p>There were now three ecclesiastical parties in England—the
Papal or Roman Catholic, the Episcopal,
or Church of England, and the Presbyterian or Puritan
party. The sympathies of the queen and of her
courtiers was much more with the Papists than with
the Presbyterians, and it was greatly feared that they
would go over to their side. The queen grew daily
more and more determined to enforce the discipline
of the English Church. The order was issued that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
all preachers should be silenced who had not been
ordained by Episcopal hands, or who refused to read
the whole service as contained in the Prayer book, or
who neglected to wear the prescribed clerical robes.
Under this law two hundred and thirty-three ministers,
in six counties, were speedily deposed. A Court
of High Commission was appointed invested with extraordinary
powers to arrest and punish all delinquents.</p>

<p>Any private person who should absent himself
from the Episcopal Church for a month, or who should
dissuade others from attending that form of worship,
or from receiving the communion from an Episcopal
clergyman, or who should be present at any “conventicle
or meeting under color or pretence of any exercise
of religion,” should be punished with imprisonment
and should be held there until he signed the “Declaration
of Conformity.” Or in default of such declaration
he was to be sent to perpetual exile under penalty
of death if he were ever again found within the
British realms.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that many were banished, and
some died in prison and several were hanged, the
cause of dissent secretly gained ground. As they
were deliberating in the House of Commons upon a
more rigid law to compel all to adopt the same creed
and the same modes of Worship, Sir Walter Raleigh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
said that he thought that there were then nearly
twenty thousand dissenters in England. Many driven
from their homes by this violent persecution emigrated
to Holland where, under Protestant rule there
was freedom of religious worship.</p>

<p>Upon the accession of James the Sixth of Scotland
to the throne of England, eight hundred clergymen
petitioned for redress. Among other things they
prayed for the disuse of the cap and surplice in the
pulpit, for an abridgement of the Liturgy, for the better
observance of the Lord’s day, and for a dispensation
of the observance of other holy days; that none
but pious men should be admitted to the ministry, and
that ministers should reside in their parishes and
preach on the Lord’s day. To this appeal the king
turned a deaf ear. In a conference which was held
upon the subject, in Hampton court, the petitioners
were received with contumely and insult. The king
refused to pay any respect to private consciences, saying,
“I will have one doctrine, one discipline, one religion.
And I will make you conform or I will harry
you out of this land or else worse.”</p>

<p>A book of Common Prayer was published as “the
only public form established in this realm,” and all
were required to conform to its ritual and discipline
as the king’s resolutions were unchangeable. Ten
of the petitioners for a redress of grievances were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
sent to jail. The king himself, a conceited pedant,
drew up a Book of Canons consisting of one hundred
and forty-one articles, expressed in the most arrogant
style of pretensions to infallibility. The clergy and
the laity were alike commanded to submit to them
under penalty of excommunication, imprisonment and
outlawry. The importation of all religious books
from the Continent was prohibited. No religious
book could be published in England unless approved
by a court of Bishops. It is estimated that, at that
time there were fifteen hundred Non-Conformist clergymen
in England. Bishop Coverdale, with many
others of the most prominent ecclesiastics of the
Episcopal church, publicly announced their refusal to
subscribe to the Liturgy or to adopt the ceremonies
it enjoined. In their protest they declared that since
“they could not have the Word freely preached, and
the sacraments administered without idolatrous gear,
they concluded to break off from the public churches
and separate in private houses.”</p>

<p>The persecution of the Non-Conformists was continued
with so much vigor, that the friends of religious
reform became hopeless. Some sought refuge in concealment,
while many fled from their country to Holland
where, the principles of Protestantism prevailing,
there was freedom of worship. In the county of
Nottinghamshire, England, there was a small village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
called Scrooby, where there was a congregation of
Non-Conformists, meeting secretly from house to
house. This was about the year 1606. A recent
traveller gives the following interesting description of
the present appearance of the little hamlet, which
more than two and a half centuries ago was rendered
memorable by the sufferings of the Puritans:</p>

<p>“The nearest way from Austerfield to Scrooby is
by a path through the fields. Unnoticed in our history
as these places have been till within a few years,
it is likely that when, towards sunset on the 15th of
September 1856, I walked along that path, I was the
first person, related to the American Plymouth, who
had done so since Bradford trod it last before his
exile. I slept in a farm-house at Scrooby and reconnoitered
that village the next morning. Its old church
is a beautiful structure. At the distance from it of a
quarter of a mile the dyke, round the vanished manor
house, may still be traced; and a farmer’s house is
believed to be part of the ancient stables or dog kennels.
In what was the garden is a mulberry tree so
old that generations, before Brewster, may have regaled
themselves with its fruit. The local tradition
declares it to have been planted by Cardinal Wolsey,
during his sojourn at the manor for some weeks after
his fall from power.”</p>

<p>The little church of Non-Conformists at Scrooby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
had Richard Clifton for pastor and John Robinson for
teacher. William Brewster, who subsequently attained
to much distinction as pastor of the Puritan
church in Plymouth, New England, was then a private
member of the church. This little band of christians
decided to emigrate in a body to Holland that they
might there worship God in freedom.</p>

<p>It was a great trial to these christians to break
away from their country, their homes, and their employments,
to seek exile in a land of strangers. To
add to their embarrassments cruel laws were passed
forbidding the emigration of any of the Non-Conformists
or Puritans as they began to be called.
Bands of armed men vigilantly guarded all the seaports.
Governor Bradford, who shared conspicuously
in these sufferings, wrote:</p>

<p>“They could not long continue in any peaceable
condition, but were hunted and persecuted on every
side. Some were taken and clapped up in prison.
Others had their houses beset and watched night and
day, and hardly escaped capture. The most were
fain to fly and leave their houses and habitations and
the means of their livelihood. Yet seeing themselves
thus molested, by a joint consent they resolved to go
into the Low Countries where they heard was freedom
of religion for all men; as also that sundry persons
from London, and other parts of the land, had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
exiled and persecuted for the same cause, and were
gone thither, and lived at Amsterdam and other
places of the land.</p>

<p>“Being thus constrained to leave their native soil
and country, their lands and living, and all their
friends and familiar acquaintance, it was much, and
thought marvellous by many. But to go into a country
they knew not except by hearsay, where they must
learn a new language, and get their livings they knew
not how, it being an expensive place and subject to
the miseries of war, it was by many thought an adventure
almost desperate, a case intolerable, and a
misery worse than death. Especially seeing they
were not acquainted with trades or traffic, by which
the country doth subsist, but had been only used to
a plain country life and the innocent trade of husbandry.</p>

<p>“But these things did not dismay them, though
they did at times trouble them, for their desires were
set on the ways of God and to enjoy his ordinances.
But they rested on His providence and knew whom
they had believed. Yet this was not all; for though
they could not stay, yet were they not suffered to go;
but the ports and havens were shut against them; so
as they were fain to seek secret means of conveyance,
and to bribe and fee the mariners, and give extraordinary
rates for their passages. And yet they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
often betrayed, many of them, and both they and their
goods intercepted and surprised, and thereby put to
great trouble.”</p>

<p>The company at Scrooby however secretly chartered
a vessel, at Boston, in Lincolnshire, about fifty
miles south-east from Scrooby, the nearest port for
their purpose. The peril of the enterprise was so
great that they had to practise the utmost caution
and to pay exorbitant passage money. They travelled
by land to the appointed rendezvous, where to
their bitter disappointment, they found neither captain
nor vessel. After a long delay and heavy expenses,
for which they were quite unprepared, the
vessel made its appearance and, in the night, all were
received on board. Then this infamous captain, having
previously agreed to do so for his “thirty pieces
of silver,” betrayed them, and delivered them all up
to the search officers.</p>

<p>Rudely they were seized, their trunks broken
open, their clothing confiscated, and even the persons
of their women searched with cruel indelicacy. Thus
plundered and outraged they were placed in open
boats and taken to the shore, where they were exhibited
to the derisive gaze and the jeers of an ignorant
and a brutal populace. A despatch was immediately
sent to the Lords of the Council in London,
and they were all committed to prison. After gloomy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
incarceration for a month, Mr. Brewster and six others
of the most prominent men were bound over for trial,
and the rest were released, woe-stricken, sick and
impoverished, to find their way back, as best they
could, to the Scrooby which they had left, and where
they no longer had any homes. Oh man! what a
fiend hast thou been in the treatment of thy brother
man!</p>

<p>The next Spring a portion of these resolute men
and women made another attempt to escape to Holland.
They did not venture again to trust one of
their own countrymen, but made a contract with a
Dutch shipmaster, from Zealand. He agreed to
have his vessel, at an appointed day, in a retired spot
upon the river Humber, not far from the seaport of
Hull. Arrangements were made for the women and
children, with their few goods, to be floated down the
Humber in a barque, while the men made the journey
by land. This was all done under the protection of
night.</p>

<p>The Humber here swells into a bay, a long and
wide arm of the sea. The wind was high, and the
little barque, plunging over the waves, made the
women and children deadly sea sick. Having arrived
near their point of destination, before the dawn
of the morning and the vessel not yet having arrived,
the boatmen put into a little creek to find still water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
Here the receding tide left them aground. In the
morning came the ship. The captain, seeing the
barque containing the women and children aground,
and the men, who had come by land walking near by
upon the shore, sent his boat to bring the men on
board, that they might be already there when the returning
tide should float the barque. One crowded
boat load had reached the ship when a body of armed
men, horse and foot, was seen rapidly approaching.
The captain was terrified. Fine, imprisonment, and
perhaps a worse fate awaited him. Uttering an oath,
he weighed anchor, spread his sails, and a fresh
breeze soon carried him out to sea.</p>

<p>Dreadful indeed was the condition of those thus
abandoned to the insults and outrages of a brutal
soldiery. Husbands and wives, parents and children
were separated. The anguish of those, thus torn from
their families, on board the ship, was no less than the
distress of the mothers and daughters left upon the
shore.</p>

<p>A storm soon rose—a terrific storm. For seven
days and nights the ship was at the mercy of the
gale, without sight of sun or moon or stars. The
ship was driven near to the coast of Norway; and
more than once the mariners thought the ship sinking
past all recovery. At length the gale abated and,
fourteen days after they had weighed anchor, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
vessel reached Amsterdam, where from the long
voyage and the fury of the tempest, their friends had
almost despaired of ever again seeing them.</p>

<p>But let us return to those who were left upon the
banks of the Humber. They were all captured.
Deplorable was the condition of these unhappy victims
of religious intolerance, women and children weeping
bitterly in their despair. Some of the men, who
knew that the rigors of the law would fall upon them
with the greatest severity, escaped. But most of
those who had been left behind by the ship allowed
themselves to be taken to share the fate of the destitute
and helpless women and children, that they might
if possible, assist them. The troops were very cruel
in the treatment of their prisoners. They were
roughly seized and hurried from one justice to
another, the officers being much embarrassed to
know what to do with them.</p>

<p>Governor Bradford, who witnessed these scenes,
writes:—“Pitiful it was to see the heavy care of
these poor women in this distress; what weeping and
crying on every side; some for their husbands that
were carried away in the ship; others not knowing
what would become of them and their little ones;
others melted in tears seeing their little ones hanging
about them, crying for fear and quaking with cold.”</p>

<p>In view of their sufferings general sympathy was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
excited in their behalf. It seemed inhuman to imprison,
in gloomy cells of stone and iron, women and
innocent children, simply because they had intended
to accompany their husbands and fathers to another
land. It was of no use to fine them, for they had
no means of paying a fine. Neither could they be
sent to their former homes, for their houses and
lands had already been sold, in preparation for their
removal.</p>

<p>At last the poor creatures were turned adrift. No
historic pen has recorded the details of their sufferings.
Some undoubtedly perished of exposure. Some
were kindly sheltered by the charitable, and some
succeeded in various ways in crossing the sea to Amsterdam.
There were similar persecutions in other
parts of England. Quite a large company of pilgrims
from various sections of England had succeeded, some
in one way and some in another, in effecting their
escape to Holland. They had nearly all taken up
their residence in Amsterdam. This flourishing city
was so called because it had sprung up around a <em>dam</em>
which had been thrown across the mouth of the <i>Amstel</i>
river. It was even then renowned for its stately buildings,
its extended commerce and its opulence. Ships,
from every clime, lined its wharfs; water craft of
every variety and in almost countless numbers floated
upon its canals, which took the place of streets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
From many parts of Europe Protestants had fled to
this city, bringing with them their arts, manufactures
and skill in trade. The emigrants from Scrooby were
nearly all farmers. They had no money to purchase
lands, and they found it very difficult to obtain remunerative
employment in the crowded streets of the
commercial city. Governor Bradford writes, of his
companions in affliction:</p>

<p>“They heard a strange and uncouth language and
beheld the different manners and customs of the people
with their strange fashions and attires; all so
different from their plain country villages, wherein
they were bred and had so long lived, as it seemed
they were come into a new world. But these were
not the things they much looked on, or which long
took up their thoughts. For they had other work in
hand and another kind of war to urge and maintain.
For it was not long before they saw the grim and
grisly face of poverty come on them, like an armed
man, with whom they must buckle and encounter and
from whom they could not fly.”</p>

<p>The new-comers did not find perfect harmony of
agreement with those who had preceded them. After
a few months tarry at Amsterdam they retired in a
body to Leyden, a beautiful city of seventy thousand
inhabitants, about forty miles distant. In allusion to
this movement Governor Bradford writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
“For these and some other reasons they removed
to Leyden, a fair and beautiful city, and of a sweet
situation; but made more famous by the university,
wherewith it is adorned, in which of late had been so
many learned men. But wanting that traffic by sea
which Amsterdam enjoys, it was not so beneficial for
their outward means of living. But being now established
here, they fell to such trades and employments
as they best could; valuing peace and their spiritual
comfort above any other riches whatever.</p>

<p>“Being thus settled, after many difficulties, they
continued many years in a comfortable condition, enjoying
much sweet and delightful society, and spiritual
comfort together in the ways of God, under the able
ministry of Mr. John Robinson and Mr. William
Brewster, who was an assistant unto him, in the place
of an Elder, unto which he was now called and chosen
by the church. So they grew in knowledge and other
gifts and graces of God, and lived together in peace
and love and holiness; and many came unto them
from diverse parts of England so as they grew a great
congregation.</p>

<p>“And if at any time any differences arose, or offenses
broke out, as it cannot be but some time there
will, even among the best of men, they were even so
met with and nipped in the head betimes, or otherwise
so well composed as still love, peace and communion
were continued.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
The condition of the Pilgrims in Holland was a very
hard one. They were foreigners; they found the language
difficult to acquire. They were generally poor,
and notwithstanding their honesty and frugality, could
obtain but a scanty support. Their sons were strongly
tempted to enlist as soldiers, or to wander away as
sailors. The future of their families seemed very
gloomy.</p>

<p>“Lastly,” writes Governor Bradford, “and which
was not least, a great hope and inward zeal they had
of laying some good foundation, or at least to make
some way thereunto for propagating and advancing
the kingdom of Christ, in those remote parts of the
world,—yea, though they should be but the stepping
stones unto others for the performing of so great a
work.”</p>

<p>“Their numbers assembled at Leyden can only be
conjectured. It may, when at the largest, have counted
between two and three hundred persons. Rev.
John Robinson was chosen their pastor, and William
Brewster their assistant pastor.”</p>

<p>Thus gradually the Pilgrims came to the conviction
that Holland was not a desirable place for their
permanent home. Notwithstanding the oppression
which they had endured from the British government,
they were very unwilling to lose their native language
or the name of Englishmen. They could not educate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
their children as they wished, and it was quite certain
their descendants would become absorbed and lost in
the Dutch nation. They therefore began to turn their
thoughts to the New World, where every variety of
clime invited them, and where boundless acres of the
most fertile land, unoccupied, seemed to be waiting
for the plough of the husbandman. “Hereby they
thought they might more glorify God, do more good
to their country, better provide for their posterity, and
live to be more refreshed by their labors than ever
they could do in Holland.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Unsuccessful attempts had already been made to
establish colonies in Maine and Virginia. They had
also received appalling reports of the ferocity of the
savages. Deeply, solemnly, they pondered the all important
question with many fastings and prayers.
Bradford writes that,</p>

<p>“They considered that all great and honorable actions
were accompanied with great difficulties, and
must be both enterprised and overcome with answerable
courages. The dangers were great, but not desperate;
the difficulties were many, but not invincible.
For, though there were many of them likely, yet they
were not certain. It might be, sundry of the things
feared might never befall; others, by provident care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
and the use of good means, might, in a great measure,
be prevented. And all of them, through the help
of God, by fortitude and patience, might either be
borne or overcome. Their ends were good and honorable,
and therefore they might expect the blessing
of God in their proceeding.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>The Dutch endeavored to induce them to join a
feeble colony which they had established at the mouth
of the Hudson river. Sir Walter Raleigh presented
in glowing terms the claims of the valley of the Orinoco,
in South America, which river he had recently
explored for the second time.</p>

<p>“We passed,” writes the enthusiastic traveller,
“the most beautiful country that my eyes ever beheld.
I never saw a more beautiful country or more lively
prospects. There is no country which yieldeth more
pleasure to its inhabitants. For health, good air,
pleasure, riches, I am resolved that it cannot be equalled
by any region either in the east or west.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>There was a small struggling English colony in
Virginia which they were urged to join. But Bradford
writes that they were afraid that they should be
as much persecuted there for their religion as if they
lived in England. After pondering for some time
these questions and perplexities, they decided to establish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
a distinct colony for themselves, obtaining their
lands from the Virginia Company in England. A delegation
was sent to the king of England, soliciting
from him a grant of freedom of worship. The Virginia
Company gladly lent its co-operation to the emigrants.
The king, however, was so unrelenting in
his desire to promote religious uniformity throughout
all his domains, that though the Secretary of State,
and others high in authority, urged him to liberality,
he could only be persuaded to give his reluctant assent
to the assurance “that his majesty would connive at
them, and not molest them, provided they carried
themselves peaceably.”</p>

<p>The very important question now arose, Who
should go. Manifestly all could not be in a condition
to cross a wide and stormy sea, for a new world, never
to return. As only a minority of the whole number
could leave, it was decided that their pastor, Mr. Robinson,
should remain with those left behind, while Elder
Brewster should accompany the emigrants as their
spiritual guide. For nearly twelve years they had resided
in Leyden. The hour of their departure was a
sad one for all. Many very grievous embarrassments
were encountered, which we have not space here to
record.</p>

<p>A small vessel of but sixty tons burden, called the
Speedwell, was purchased, and was in the harbor at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Delft Haven, twelve miles from Leyden, awaiting the
arrival of the pilgrims. Their friends, who remained,
gave them a parting feast. It was truly a religious
festival.</p>

<div id="ip_28" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 33.6875em;">
  <img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="539" height="384" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><i>DELFT-HAVEN.</i></div></div>

<p>“The feast,” writes Winslow, “was at the pastor’s
house, which was large. Earnest were the prayers
for each other, and mutual the pledges. With hymns,
prayers, and the interchange of words of love and
cheer, a few hours were passed.” The pilgrims, then,
about one hundred and twenty in number, accompanied
by many of their Leyden friends, repaired on
board canal boats, and were speedily conveyed to Delft
Haven. Here another parting scene took place. The
description of it, as given by Bradford, in his “Brief
Narration,” is worthy of record:</p>

<p>“The night before the embarkation was spent with
little sleep by the most; but with friendly entertainment
and Christian discourse, and other real expressions
of true Christian love. The next day, the wind
being fair, they went on board, and their friends with
them, where truly doleful was the sight of that sad
and mournful parting. To see what sighs and sobs
did sound among them; what tears did gush from
every eye, and pithy speeches pierced each heart; that
sundry of the Dutch strangers that stood on the quay
as spectators, could not refrain from tears. Yet comfortable
and sweet it was to see such lively and true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
expressions of dear and unfeigned love. But the tide,
which stays for no man, calling them away that were
thus loath to part, their reverend pastor falling down
upon his knees, and they all, with him, with watery
cheeks, commended them, with most fervent prayers
to the Lord and His blessing. And then, with mutual
embraces and many tears, they took their leaves one
of another.”</p>

<p>On the 22d of July, 1620, the Speedwell, with its
little band of Christian heroes, left the haven of Delft
for England.</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Robinson and his friends returned sadly
to Leyden. A prosperous wind rapidly bore the vessel
across the channel to the British coast, and they entered
the port of Southampton. Here they found a
party of English emigrants who had chartered a vessel,
the Mayflower, of one hundred and twenty tons.
They were awaiting the arrival of the Speedwell, intending
to unite with the Leyden band and sail in its
company for the organization of a Christian colony in
the New World.</p>

<p>Here, disappointed in some of their financial plans,
it was found that they needed four hundred dollars to
pay up sundry bills, before they could sail. To raise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
this money they were compelled to sell some of their
provisions, including many firkins of butter, which luxury
they thought they could best spare.</p>

<p>At length, all things being ready, both vessels
weighed anchor and put to sea, from Southampton, on
the 5th of August. In the two vessels there were
about one hundred and twenty passengers. They had
gone but about one hundred miles when Captain Reynolds,
of the Speedwell, announced that his ship had
sprung a leak, and that he did not dare to continue the
voyage without having her examined and repaired.
Both vessels, therefore, put into Dartmouth, losing a
fair wind, and time which, with the rapidly passing
summer weather, was invaluable to them. They were
detained for more than a week, searching out the leaks
and mending them. One of their number, Mr. Cushman,
wrote from Dartmouth a doleful letter, full of anticipations
of evil.</p>

<p>“We put in here,” he wrote, “to trim our vessel;
and I think, as do others, also, that if we had stayed
at sea for three or four hours more she would have
sunk right down. And, though she was twice trimmed
at Southampton, yet now she is open and leaky
as a sieve. We lay at Southampton seven days in fair
weather waiting for her; and now we lie here in as fair
a wind as can blow, and so have done these four days,
and are like to do four days more; and by that time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
the wind will probably turn, as it did at Southampton.
Our victuals will be half eaten up, I think, before we
go from the coast of England. And if our voyage last
long we shall not have a month’s victuals when we
come into the country.</p>

<p>“If I should write to you all things which promiscuously
forebode our ruin, I should overcharge my
weak head and grieve your tender heart. Only this I
pray you, prepare for evil tidings of us every day. I
see not in reason how we shall escape even the gaspings
of hunger-starved persons. But God can do
much, and His will be done.”</p>

<p>Again the two vessels set sail, probably about the
21st of August.</p>

<p>They had been out but a day or two, having made
about three hundred miles from Land’s End, keeping
close company, when the commander of the Speedwell
hung out a signal of distress. Both vessels hove to
and it appeared that the Speedwell had sprung a leak,
of so serious a character that, though diligently plying
the pumps, they could scarcely keep her afloat.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be done but to put back again to
Plymouth, the nearest English port. Here the Speedwell
was carefully examined, and pronounced to be,
from general weakness, unseaworthy. The disappointment
was very great. The vessel was abandoned;
twenty passengers were left behind, who could not be
received in the already crowded Mayflower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
“It was resolved,” writes Governor Bradford, “to
dismiss the Speedwell and part of the company, and
proceed with the other ship. The which, though it
was grievous and caused great discouragement, was
put in execution. So, after they had taken out such
provisions as the other ship could well stow, and concluded
what number and what persons to send back,
they made another sad parting, the one ship going
back to London, the other proceeding on her voyage.
Those who went back were, for the most part, those
who were willing so to do, either out of some discontent,
or from fear they conceived of the ill success of
the voyage, seeing so many crosses befal, and the time
of the year so far spent. But others, in regard to
their weakness and charge of many young children,
were thought least useful, and most unfit to bear the
brunt of this hard adventure; unto which work of
God and judgment of their brethren they were contented
to submit. And thus, like Gideon’s army, this
small number was divided, as if the Lord, by this work
of His providence, thought these few too many for
the great work He had to do. But here, by the way,
let me show, how afterwards it was found that the leakiness
of this ship was partly caused by being overmasted
and too much pressed with sails; for after she was
sold and put into her old trim, she made many voyages
and performed her service very sufficiently, to the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
profit of her owners. But more especially by the cunning
and deceit of the master and his company, who
were hired to remain a whole year in America; and
now, fancying dislike, and fearing want of victuals,
they plotted this stratagem to free themselves, as afterwards
was known, and by some of them confessed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cushman, who wrote the doleful letter, was
left behind at his own request. There was some excuse
for his evil forebodings, for he was in a wretched
state of health. He had written,</p>

<p>“Besides the imminent dangers of this voyage,
which are no less than deadly, an infirmity of body
hath seized me which will not, in all likelihood, leave
me until death. What to call it I know not. But it
is a bundle of lead, as it were, crushing my heart more
and more these fourteen days; and, though I do the
actions of a living man, yet I am but as dead.”</p>

<p>The whole number of persons who took their departure
from Dartmouth, in the one solitary vessel,
the Mayflower, for the New World, amounted to one
hundred and two.</p>

<p>Among these passengers there was a marked man,
to whom we have already alluded, Captain Miles
Standish. He was a native of Lancashire, England,
a gentleman born, and the legitimate heir to a large
estate. He had been for some time an officer in one
of the British regiments, which had garrisoned a town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
in the Netherlands. He was not a church member,
and we know not what induced him to unite with the
pilgrims in their perilous enterprise. Probably love
of adventure, sympathy with them in their cruel persecution,
and attachment to some of the emigrants,
were the motives which influenced him. It is certain
that he was very highly esteemed, and very cordially
welcomed by the pilgrims. His military skill might
prove of great value to the infant colony.</p>

<p>It is but little that we know of the early life of this
remarkable man. He was born about the year 1584,
and was, consequently, at this time, about thirty-six
years of age. The family could boast of a long and
illustrious line of ancestors. In the great controversy
between the Catholics and the Protestants there was
a division in the family, part adhering to the ancient
faith, and part accepting the Protestant religion.
Thus there arose, as it were, two families; the Catholics,
who were of “Standish Hall,” and the Protestants,
who were of “Duxbury Hall.” Both of these
family seats are situated near the village of Chorley,
in the county of Lancashire. The income of the
whole property was large, being estimated at about
five hundred thousand dollars a year.</p>

<p>It is probable that Miles Standish was the legal
heir to all this property, and that, by gross injustice,
he was defrauded of it. A few years ago the heirs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
Miles Standish, in this country, sent out an agent, Mr.
Bromley, to examine into the title. He thoroughly
searched the records of the parish for more than a
hundred years, embracing the period between 1549
and 1652. The result of this investigation was fully
convincing, to the mind of Mr. Bromley, that Miles
Standish was the rightful heir to the property, but that
the legal evidence had been fraudulently destroyed.
In reference to this investigation, Mr. Justin Winsor,
in his History of Duxbury, writes:</p>

<p>“The records were all readily deciphered, with the
exception of the years 1584 and 1585; the very dates
about which time Standish is supposed to have been
born. The parchment leaf, which contained the registers
of the births of these years was wholly illegible;
and their appearance was such that the conclusion was
at once established that it had been purposely done
with pumice stone, or otherwise, to destroy the legal
evidence of the parentage of Standish, and his consequent
title to the estates thereabout. The mutilation
of these pages is supposed to have been accomplished
when, about twenty years before, similar enquiries
were made by the family in America.”</p>

<p>Young Miles was educated to the military profession.
England was then in alliance with the Dutch,
in one of those wars with which the continent of Europe
has ever been desolated. Miles was sent to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Netherlands, commissioned as a lieutenant in Queen
Elizabeth’s forces. After peace was declared he remained
in the country and attached himself to the
English exiles, who, in Leyden, had found refuge from
ecclesiastical oppression. He joined the first company
of Pilgrims for America, and by his bravery and
sagacity, contributed greatly to the success of their heroic
enterprise.</p>

<p>Nothing of special moment occurred during the
voyage, which was tedious, occupying sixty-four days.
One event is recorded by Bradford as a special providence.
One of the seamen, a young man of vigorous
health and lusty frame, was a very vile fellow. As he
went swaggering about the decks he lost no opportunity
to insult the Pilgrims, ever treating their religious
faith with contempt. When he saw any suffering from
the awful depression of sea sickness, he would openly
curse them, and express the wish that he might have
the pleasure of throwing their bodies overboard, before
they should reach the end of the voyage. The
slightest reproof would only cause him to curse and
swear more bitterly. Why the captain of the Mayflower
allowed this conduct, we are not informed. But
there are other indications that he was not very cordially
in sympathy with his persecuted, comparatively
friendless, but illustrious passengers. When about
half way across the Atlantic, the dissolute young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
was seized with sudden and painful sickness. Several
days of severe suffering passed, as his ribald songs
and oaths were hushed in the languor of approaching
death. He died miserably, and his body, wrapped in
a tarred sheet, was cast into the sea. “Thus,” writes
Bradford, “did his curses light upon his own head.
And it was an astonishment to all his fellows, for they
noted it to be the just hand of God upon him.”</p>

<p>Very rough storms were encountered, often with
head winds, and the frail Mayflower was sorely strained
and wrenched by gale and surge. The shrouds were
broken, the sails were rent, and seams were opened,
through the oaken ribs, which threatened the engulfing
of the ship in the yawning waves. Almost a mutiny
was excited, as some, deeming the shattered bark
incapable of performing the voyage, urged the abandonment
of the expedition, and a return. After a
careful examination, by the captain and the officers, of
the injury the vessel had received, it was decided that
the hull of the ship, under water, was still strong;
that, to tighten the seam opened by the main beam,
they had on board an immense iron screw, which the
passengers had brought from Holland, which would
raise the beam to its place; and that, by carefully
calking the decks and upper works, and by the cautious
avoidance of spreading too much sail, they might
still, in safety, brave the perils of a stormy sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
But we are told that many gales arose so fierce,
and the sea ran so high, that for days together they
could not spread an inch of canvass, but, in nautical
phrase, were compelled to scud under bare poles. In
one of these terrific storms a young man, John Howland,
who ventured upon deck, was, by the sudden
lurching of the vessel and the breaking of a wave,
swept into the sea. He seemed to have been carried
down fathoms deep under the raging billows. But,
providentially, he caught hold of the topsail halyards,
which happened to hang overboard. Though they ran
out to full length, still, with a death gripe, he kept his
hold until he was drawn up to the surface of the water,
when, with boat hooks and other means, he was rescued.</p>

<p>The first land they made was Cape Cod. But it
had been their intention to seek a settlement somewhere
near the mouth of Hudson river. They therefore
tacked about and stood for the southward. But
after sailing with a fair wind for half a day, they found
themselves becalmed in the midst of dangerous shoals
and wild breakers. Alarmed by the perils which surrounded
them in such unknown seas, they resolved to
make their way back and seek the protection of the
cape. A gentle breeze rose in their favor, and swept
them away from the shoals before night came on.
The next morning they anchored their storm-shattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
vessel in a safe harbor at the extremity of Cape
Cod.</p>

<p>Governor Bradford writes feelingly: “Being thus
arrived in a good harbor, and brought safe to land,
they fell upon their knees and blessed the God of
Heaven, who had brought them over the vast and furious
ocean, and delivered them from all the perils and
miseries thereof, again to set their feet on the firm and
stable earth, their proper element.”</p>

<p>He continues in language which we slightly modernize:
“But here I cannot but stay and make a pause,
and stand half amazed at this poor people’s present
condition. And so I think will the reader too, when
he well considers the same. Being thus past the vast
ocean, and a sea of troubles before in their preparation,
they had now no friends to welcome them, nor
inns to entertain or refresh their weather-beaten bodies,—no
houses, or much less, towns to repair to, to
seek for succor.</p>

<p>“It is recorded in Scripture, as a mercy to the
apostle and his shipwrecked company, that the barbarians
showed them no small kindness in refreshing
them; but these savage barbarians, when they met
with them, as after will appear, were readier to fill
their sides full of arrows than otherwise. And for the
season, it was winter; and they that know the winters
of this country, know them to be sharp and violent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
and subject to cruel and fierce storms, dangerous to
travel to known places, much more to search an unknown
coast. Besides, what could they see but a hideous
and desolate wilderness, full of wild beasts and
wild men? And what multitudes there might be
of them they knew not. Neither could they, as
it were, go up to the top of Pisgah to view, from
this wilderness, a more goodly country to feed their
hopes.</p>

<p>“For, which way soever they turned their eyes,
save upward to the heavens, they could have little solace
or content in respect of any outward objects.
For, summer being done, all things stand upon them
with a weather-beaten face, and the whole country,
full of woods and thickets, presented a wild and savage
view. If they looked behind them there was the
mighty ocean, which they had passed, and which was
now as a main bar and gulf to separate them from all
the civil parts of the world. If it be said they had a
ship to succor them, it is true; but what heard they
daily from the master and company, but that with
speed they should look out a place with their shallop,
where they would be at some near distance; for the
season was such that he would not stir from thence
till a safe harbor was discovered by them, where they
would be left, and where he might go without danger;
and that victuals consumed apace, but that he must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
and he would keep sufficient for the crew and their
return. Yea, it was muttered by some, that if the
Pilgrims got not a place soon, they would turn them
and their goods ashore and leave them.”</p>

<p>It was in the morning of Saturday, November
11th, that the Mayflower, rounding the white sand
cliffs of what is now Provincetown, on the extremity
of Cape Cod, entered the bay on the western side of
the Cape, where they cast anchor. Just before entering
this harbor the Pilgrims had drawn up a brief
constitution of civil government, upon the basis of republicanism,
by which they mutually bound themselves
to be governed. This was the germ of the
American Constitution. John Carver they had unanimously
chosen as their Governor for one year.</p>

<p>That afternoon a party of sixteen men, well armed,
under Captain Miles Standish, was sent on shore to
explore the country in their immediate vicinity. They
returned in the early evening with rather a discouraging
report. The land was sandy and poor, but covered
with quite a dense forest of evergreens, dwarf
oaks and other deciduous trees. They could find no
fresh water, and met with no signs of inhabitants.
The peninsula there seemed to be a mere sand bank,
a tongue of barren land, about a mile in breadth.
The water in the bay, however, abounded with fish
and sea fowl. They brought on board much-needed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
fuel of the red cedar, which emitted, in burning, a
grateful fragrance.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. These devout men,
who had left their native land to encounter all the
hardships and perils of the wilderness, that they might
worship God freely, according to their own sense of
duty, kept the day holy to the Lord. They had brought
with them, as their pastor, as we have mentioned, the
Rev. William Brewster. He was a gentleman by
birth and in all his habits; a man of fervent piety and
of highly cultivated mind, having graduated at Cambridge
University, and having already filled several
responsible stations in church and state. Mr. Brewster
preached from the deck of the Mayflower. In
their temple, whose majestic dome was the overarching
skies, their hymns blended with the moan of the
wintry wind, and the dash of the surge on the rock-bound
shore.</p>

<p>The next morning, refreshed by the repose of the
Sabbath, the Pilgrims rose early to enter upon the arduous
duties before them. The prospect of gloomy
forests, barren sands and wild ocean, was any thing
but cheerful. No alluring spot of grove or meadow
or rivulet invited them to land. Weary as they were
of their small and crowded bark, it was still preferable
to any residence which the shore offered them.
Still these heroic men indulged in no despondency.
The martyr spirit of Elder Brewster animated his
whole flock. Just before sailing for the New World,
he had said to Sir Edward Sandys:</p>

<p>“It is not with us as with other men, whom small
things can discourage, or small discontents cause to
wish themselves home again. We believe and trust
that the Lord is with us, unto whom and whose service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
we have given ourselves, and that he will graciously
prosper our endeavors according to the simplicity
of our hearts therein.”</p>

<p>The captain of the Mayflower was unwilling to
leave the harbor at Cape Cod and peril his vessel by
coasting about in those unknown seas in search for a
suitable location for the colony. The Pilgrims had
taken the precaution to bring with them a large shallop,
whose framework, but partially put together, was
stowed away in the hold of the vessel. They now got
out these pieces, and their carpenter commenced
vigorously the work of preparing the boat for service.
It would require some days to put the shallop in order
for a tour of exploration along the shore. There
were twenty-eight females among the emigrants.
Eighteen of these were married women, accompanying
their husbands. These females, attended by a
strong guard of armed men, were landed Monday
morning to wash the soiled clothes which had accumulated
through the long voyage. The weather was
excessively cold, and the water so shoal that the boat
could not come within several rods of the shore. The
men were compelled to wade through the water, carrying
the women in their arms; thus with many of
them was laid the foundation of serious and fatal
sickness.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while these labors were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
performed, Captain Miles Standish, on Wednesday
morning, the 15th of November, set out with a party
of fifteen men, well armed and provisioned, for a more
extended tour of exploration. It was deemed rather
a hazardous enterprise, as they knew not but that the
woods were filled with savages, lying in ambush.
The Mayflower was anchored, it is supposed, about a
furlong from the end of what is now called Long
Point, and at that place the men were probably set
on shore.</p>

<p>Mourt writes: “The willingness of the persons
was liked, but the thing itself, in regard to the danger,
was rather permitted than approved. And so, with
cautious directions and instructions, sixteen men were
set out, with every man his musket, sword and corslet,
under the conduct of Captain Miles Standish,
unto whom was adjoined, for counsel and advice, William
Bradford, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Tilley.”</p>

<p>The exploring party followed along the coast for
the distance of about a mile, when they saw six or seven
Indians, with a dog, approaching them. As soon as
the savages caught sight of the party of white men,
they seemed to be much terrified, and fled precipitately
into the woods. The Pilgrims hotly pursued,
hoping to open with them amicable relations. The
Indians, seeing themselves thus followed, turned
again from the woods to the sea shore, where, upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the beach, their flight would be unobstructed by the
bushes and branches, which impeded their flight in
the forest. Their pursuers kept close after them,
guided by the tracks of their feet in the sand.</p>

<p>Night now came on. The Pilgrims constructed a
rude camp, with protecting ramparts of logs, built a
rousing camp fire, for the night was cold as well as
dark, and having established faithful sentinels, slept
quietly until morning. The place of the bivouac, they
supposed to be about ten miles from the vessel. The
next morning, Thursday, November 16th, at the earliest
dawn, the Pilgrims resumed their tour. They
followed the track of the Indians from the shore into
the woods. “We marched through boughs and bushes
and under hills and valleys, which tore our very armor
in pieces, and yet could meet with none of them,
nor their houses, nor find any fresh water, which we
greatly desired and stood in need of.”</p>

<p>About ten o’clock in the morning they entered a
deep valley, where they perceived tracks of deer, and
found, to their great joy, a spring, bubbling cool and
fresh from its mossy bed. Having refreshed themselves
with a beverage which they pronounced to be
superior to any wine or beer which they had ever
drank, they pressed on their way, pushing directly
south, and soon found themselves again upon the sea
shore, where they built a large fire, that its smoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
ascending through the silent air, might inform those
on board the ship of the point which they had
reached.</p>

<p>Then, continuing their journey, they soon entered
another valley, where they found a fine clear pond of
fresh water. This was undoubtedly the little lake
which now gives name to the Pond Village in Truro.
As they journeyed on they came to a plain of cleared
land, consisting of about fifty acres, where the plough
could be driven almost without obstruction. There
were many indications that this land had formerly
been planted with corn. Turning again into the interior,
they came to several singular looking mounds,
covered with old mats. Digging into one of these,
they found decaying bows and arrows, and other indications
that they were Indian graves. Reverently
they replaced the weapons and again covered up the
grave, as they would not have the Indians think that
they would violate their sepulchres.</p>

<p>Further on they found an immense store of strawberries,
large and very delicious. This seems very
remarkable at that season of the year. Roger Williams
writes: “This berry is the wonder of all fruits,
growing naturally in those parts. In some places,
where the natives have planted, I have many times
seen as many as would fill a good ship within a few
miles compass.” They found, also, abundance of walnuts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
and grape vines, with some very good grapes.
Coming upon a deserted dwelling, they found, to their
astonishment, a large iron kettle, which must have
been taken from some ship, wrecked upon the coast.
Upon examining the remains of the hut more carefully,
they became satisfied that it must have been
erected by some sailors from Europe, who probably
had been cast away upon the coast.</p>

<p>Here they came upon another mound, newly made,
so different from the others that they were induced to
examine it. “In it we found a little old basket, full
of fair Indian corn, and digged further and found a
fine, great new basket, full of very fair corn of this
year, with some six and thirty goodly ears of corn,
some yellow and some red, and others mixed with
blue, which was a very goodly sight. The basket was
round and narrow at the top. It held about three or
four bushels, which was as much as two of us could
lift from the ground, and was very handsomely and
cunningly made.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The Pilgrims had never seen corn before. Though
they knew from its appearance that it must constitute
an important article of food, they could have had no
conception of the infinite value those golden kernels
would contribute to the millions of inhabitants destined
to throng this broad continent. These holes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the earth were the Indian barns. They were constructed
so as to hold about a hogshead each. The
corn having been husked and thoroughly dried in the
sun, was placed in baskets surrounded with mats,
which were woven or braided with flags. As the provisions
of the Pilgrims were nearly expended, from
their unexpectedly long voyage, the sight of the golden
ears of corn was more grateful to them than so many
doubloons would have been.</p>

<p>“We were in suspense,” writes one of these explorers,
“what to do with it and the kettle. At
length, after much consultation, we concluded to take
the kettle and as much of the corn as we could carry
away with us. And when our shallop came, if we
could find any of the people, and come to parley with
them, we would give them the kettle again, and satisfy
them for their corn.”</p>

<p>About eight months after this, as we shall have
occasion hereafter to mention, they met the Indians
and paid them to their “full content.” The loose corn
they put in the kettle, for two of the men to carry away
on a staff. They also filled their pockets with the
corn. The remainder they carefully buried again, “for
we were so laden with armor that we could carry no
more.” It is worthy of note that the Pilgrims were
cased in armor. One of the grandsons of Miles
Standish is said to have in his possession the coat of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
mail which his illustrious ancestor wore upon this occasion.
The Pilgrim Society of Plymouth claims also
to have the identical sword blade used by Miles Standish.</p>

<p>Not far from this place they found the remains of
an old fort, which had doubtless been built by the
same persons who erected the hut and owned the kettle.
This was near a spot which they at first supposed
to be a river, but which proved to be an arm of
the sea, and which was doubtless the entrance of
what is now called Parmet River. They found here
a high cliff of sand, since called Old Tom’s Hill, after
an Indian chief who had his wigwam upon its summit.
They were, at this spot, about nine miles from Cape
Cod harbor. Two birch bark canoes had been left
here by the Indians, one on each bank of the creek.
As the adventurers had received directions not to be
absent more than two days, they had no time for extensive
explorations. Returning to the fresh water
pond, they established their rendezvous for the night.
Building an immense fire, with the barricade to the
windward, and establishing three sentinels, each man
to take his turn as it came, they sought such sleep as
could be found in a drenching rain, for the night
proved dark and stormy.</p>

<p>In the morning they set out on their return home,
and lost their way. As they wandered along they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
entered a well-trodden deer path in the entangled
forest. Here they came upon a singular contrivance,
apparently some sort of a trap, which they were carefully
examining, when Mr. Bradford, subsequently
Governor, found himself suddenly caught by the leg
and snapped up into the air. As he experienced no
serious injury, the incident afforded only occasion for
merriment. It was a deer trap, ingeniously constructed
by bending a strong sapling to the earth, with a
rope and noose concealed under leaves covered with
acorns.</p>

<p>“It was a very pretty device,” writes Mourt,
“made with a rope of their own making, having a
noose as artificially made as any roper in England can
make.” These traps were so strong that a horse would
be tossed up if he were caught in one of them. “An
English mare,” writes Wood, “having strayed from
her owner, and grown wild by her long sojourning in
the woods, ranging up and down with the wild crew,
stumbled into one of these traps, which stopped her
speed, hanging her, like Mahomet’s coffin, betwixt
earth and heaven.”</p>

<p>Toiling along through the wilderness, they saw
three bucks and a flock of partridges, but could not
get a shot at them. “As we came along by the creek
we saw great flocks of wild geese and ducks, but they
were very fearful of us, so we marched some while in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the woods, some while on the sands, and other while
in the water up to the knees, till at length we came
near the ship, when we shot off our pieces, and the
long boat came to fetch us.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Those familiar with
the locality can trace their route as they passed round
the head of East Harbor Creek, and went down on
the north side of it. They then waded through
Stout’s Creek, near Gull Hill, and passed on to the end
of Long Point, near which the ship was anchored.</p>

<p>It was Friday afternoon, November 17th, when
the expedition returned, with rent clothes and blistered
feet, and with a discouraging report; for they
had found no place suitable for the location of their
colony.</p>

<p>Another Sunday came, and this little band of exiles
was again assembled, on the deck of the Mayflower,
to attend to their accustomed worship. The
whole of the ensuing week was employed in refitting
the shallop, which required the labor of seventeen
days, and in making preparation for another and more
extensive tour along the coast.</p>

<p>On Monday of the next week, the 27th of November,
twenty-four of the colonists and ten of the seamen,
in the shallop, all under command of Captain
Jones, of the Mayflower, again set out in search of a
spot where they might commence their lonely settlement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
in the wilderness. It was a dreary winter’s day,
with clouds, a rough sea, freezing winds and flurries
of rain and sleet. The sand hills, whitened with snow,
swept by the wind and covered with a stunted growth
of oaks and pines, presented nothing alluring to the
eye. As the day wore away and the storm increased
in violence, they ran in towards the shore for security.
Here the shallop cast anchor, under the lee of the sand
hills, in comparatively smooth water. The crew passed
the night in the boat, which probably afforded shelter
for a few persons. A party landed, and following
along the beach about six miles, encamped, with a
glowing fire at their feet.</p>

<p>The next morning, the storm still continuing, the
shallop reached them about eleven o’clock, and taking
them on board, continued their voyage until they arrived
at Pamet Creek, which the previous expedition
had visited. Here they found a sheltered cove, which
they called Cold Harbor. It afforded a safe refuge
for boats, but was not a suitable harbor for ships, as
it had a depth of but twelve feet of water at flood tide.
The creek here separates into two streams, running
back about three and a half miles into the country,
and separated by the high cliff of which we have spoken,
called Tom’s Hill.</p>

<p>A party landed at the foot of the cliff and marched
into the interior, between the streams, four or five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
miles. The country was broken with steep hills and
deep valleys, and there was six inches of snow upon
the ground. As night darkened over them they entered
a small grove of pine trees, where they built
their camp and kindled their fire, and established their
sentinels for the night. They supped luxuriously
upon three fat geese and six ducks, which they had
shot by the way.</p>

<p>It was their intention in the morning to follow up
this creek to its head, supposing that they should
there find emptying into it a river of fresh water. But
in talking the matter over, it seemed to the majority
that the region was very undesirable. It was rough,
hilly, with poor soil, and a harbor fit only for boats.
In the morning, consequently, the shallop returned to
its anchorage at the mouth of the creek, while the
party on land crossed over to the other stream to get
the rest of the corn which they had left behind.
Here they found one of the canoes, of which we have
previously spoken, which was sufficiently capacious to
carry seven or eight over at a time. Here they found
several other depositories of corn, so that they obtained
seven or eight bushels.</p>

<p>“And sure it was God’s good providence,” writes
Mourt, “that we found this corn, for else we know not
how we should have done; for we knew not how we
should find or meet with any of the Indians, except it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
be to do us a mischief. Also we had never, in all
likelihood, seen a grain of it if we had not made our
first journey; for the ground was now covered with
snow, and so hard frozen that we were fain, with our
cutlasses and short swords, to hew and carve the
ground a foot deep, and then wrest it up with levers,
for we had forgot to bring other tools.”</p>

<p>Captain Jones, satisfied that there was no place
here for the location of the colony, was quite discouraged
and wished to return to the ship. Several others
were quite sick from exposure and fatigue. They
therefore returned to the shallop, while eighteen remained
to continue their exploration until the next
day, when the shallop was to come to take them.
Several Indian trails were discovered, leading in various
directions into the woods. One of these they
followed five or six miles without finding any signs of
inhabitants. Returning by another route, they came
to a plain which had been cultivated, where they
found several Indian graves, and among them manifestly
the grave of a white man. In it they found fine
yellow hair, some embalming powder, a knife, a pack-needle,
and two or three iron instruments, bound up
in a sailor’s canvas coat. It was supposed that the
Indians had thus buried the man to honor him.</p>

<p>While thus ranging about, some of them came
upon two deserted Indian huts. They were made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
round, like an arbor, of long saplings, each end being
stuck into the ground. The door was about three
feet high, protected by a mat. The chimney was a
hole in the top. In the centre of them, one could
easily stand upright. The fire was built in the centre,
around which the inmates slept on mats. The sides
and roof were warmly sheathed, as a protection from
wind and rain, with thick mats. A few very mean
articles of household furniture were found within,
such as bowls, trays and earthen pots. There were
also quite a variety of baskets, some of them quite
curiously wrought. Some of these baskets were filled
with parched acorns, which it subsequently appeared
they often used instead of corn.</p>

<p>During the day the shallop arrived. The latter
part of the afternoon they hastened on board, with
their treasures, and, it is supposed, reached the Mayflower
that evening. In Mourt’s narrative it is recorded:
“We intended to have brought some beads
and other things, to have left in the houses in sign of
peace, and that we meant to truck with them. But
it was not done, by means of our hasty coming away
from Cape Cod.”</p>

<p>The question was then very earnestly and anxiously
discussed, whether they should decide upon
Cold Harbor for their settlement, or send out another
expedition on an exploring tour. Those who were in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
favor of Cold Harbor for their settlement, wished to
locate their dwellings upon the bluff, at the entrance
of Pamet River, now called Old Tom’s Hill. The arguments
they urged were, that there was there a convenient
harbor for boats; convenient corn land ready
to their hands; that Cape Cod would be a good place
for fishing, as they daily saw great whales swimming
about; that the place was healthy and defensible,
and most important of all, that the heart of winter
had come, and that they could not embark on more
exploring tours without danger of losing both boat
and men. The question, however, was settled in the
negative, in view of the shallowness of the harbor,
the barrenness of the land, and the inadequate supply
of fresh water.</p>

<p>But very little was then known of Massachusetts
Bay. But the second mate of the ship, Robert Coppin,
had been in that region before. He said that
upon the other side of the Bay, at a distance of about
twenty-five miles, in a direct line west from Cape Cod,
was a large navigable river with a good harbor. It
was decided immediately to fit out another expedition
to explore the whole coast of Massachusetts Bay, as
far as the mouth of that fabulous river, but not to go
beyond that point. A party of ten picked men,
among whom were Governor Carver and William
Bradford, set out in the shallop in the afternoon of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
6th of December, upon this all-important expedition,
in which it seemed absolutely necessary that they
should select some spot on which to establish their
colony. They were well armed and provisioned, and
it was certain that they would leave nothing untried
which human energy could accomplish. It was a perilous
enterprise in the dead of winter, in a comparatively
open boat upon a storm-swept sea.</p>

<p>A cold wind ploughed the bay, raising such waves
that many of the voyagers were deathly sick. It was
late in the afternoon before they succeeded in clearing
the harbor. The severity of the winter weather was
such that the spray, dashing over them, was immediately
frozen, covering them with coats of ice. They
ran down the coast in a southerly direction, about
twenty miles, when, doubling a point of land, they
entered a small shallow cove, where they discovered
twelve Indians on the beach, cutting up a grampus.
As they turned their bow towards the land the Indians
fled, and soon disappeared in the stunted growth
behind the sand hills. The water in the little bay
was so shallow that they found it difficult to approach
the shore. At last they effected a landing about three
miles from the point where they had seen the Indians,
but even then they had to wade several yards through
the water up to their knees. As the weather was intensely
cold, this caused much suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
It was quite dark before they reached the land.
With considerable difficulty they constructed a barricade
of logs, to shelter them from the wind, and also
to protect them from the arrows of the natives, should
they be attacked. Sentinels were stationed to keep
a vigilant guard, a roaring fire was built, and our
weary exiles, wrapped in their cloaks and with their
feet to the fire, soon forgot, for a few hours, all their
troubles in the oblivion of sleep. During the night
the sentinels could see, at the distance of but a few
miles, the gleam of the camp fire of the Indians.</p>

<p>In the morning the company divided, a part to follow
along the shore through the woods to see if they
could find any suitable place for their settlement,
while the rest sailed along slowly in the boat, noticing
the depth of water and watching for harbors. Thus
the day passed without any successful results. Those
on the shore followed an Indian trail for some distance
into the woods. They came to a large burying
place, surrounded with a palisade and quite thickly
filled with graves. As the sun of the short winter’s
day was sinking, and the shades of another night were
coming on, the boat put into a small creek, where its
inmates were soon joined by the party from the
woods. They met joyfully, for they had not seen one
another since the morning, and some anxiety was felt
for the safety of those upon the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Governor Bradford, who was of the party, says that
they made a barricade, as they were accustomed to
do every night, of logs, stakes and thick pine boughs,
the height of a man, leaving it open to the leeward,
partly to shelter it from the cold and winds, making
their fire in the middle and lying round about it, and
partly to defend them from any assaults of the savages,
if they should attack them. So, being very weary,
they betook themselves to rest.</p>

<p>“But about midnight they heard a hideous and
great cry, and their sentinel called ‘arm! arm!’ So
they bestirred themselves and stood to their arms and
shot off a couple of muskets, and then the noise
ceased. They concluded that it was a company of
wolves, or such like wild beasts; for one of the seamen
told them that he had often heard such a noise in Newfoundland.
So they rested till about five of the clock
in the morning, for the tide and their purpose to go
from thence made them bestirring betimes.</p>

<p>“After prayer they prepared for breakfast, and it
being day-dawning, it was thought best to be carrying
things down to the boat. But some said that it was
not best to carry the arms down; others said they
would be the readier, for they had wrapped them up
in their coats, from the dew. But some three or four
would not carry theirs until they went themselves;
yet, as it fell out, those who took their arms to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
boat, the water not being high enough for the boat to
come to the shore, they laid them down upon the bank
and came back to breakfast.</p>

<p>“But presently, all on the sudden, they heard a
great and strange cry, which they knew to be the
same voices which they heard in the night, though
they varied their notes; and one of their company
being abroad, came running in and cried, ‘Indians!
Indians!’ Immediately a shower of arrows fell upon
the encampment. Then men ran with all speed to
recover their arms, as by the good providence of God
they succeeded in doing.</p>

<p>“In the mean time, Captain Miles Standish, having
a snaphance<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> ready, made a shot, and, after him,
another. After they two had shot, other two were
ready; but Captain Standish wished us not to shoot
till we could take aim, for he knew not what need we
should have. Then there were four only of us which
had their arms there ready, and stood before the open
side of our barricade which was first assaulted. They
thought it best to defend it lest the enemy should
take it and our stuff, and so have the more vantage
against us.”</p>

<p>From the hideous yells of the Indians it seemed
as though the woods were full of them. There might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
be ten or twenty Indians to one white man. It was
greatly to be feared that they might, by a sudden rush,
seize the shallop, and thus cut off all possibility of
retreat. Captain Standish, therefore, immediately
divided his little army of ten men, leaving five to defend
the barricade and five to protect the boat. In
the midst of the terrific turmoil and storm of Indian
missiles, the two divisions, separated but by a distance
of a few yards, cheered each other by encouraging
words. Most of the guns were matchlocks.
Those by the shallop called for a firebrand to light
their matches. One seized from the fire a burning
log and carried it to them. The Indians seemed to
understand the act, for they redoubled the fury of
their yells.</p>

<p>The thick winter garments of the Pilgrims and
their coats of mail effectually protected a large portion
of their bodies from the arrows of the natives. The
arrows as, unlike bullets they could be seen in their
flight, could also be dodged. There was one Indian,
of gigantic stature, apparently more brave than the
rest, who seemed to be the leader of the band. He
was in advance of all the other Indians, and, standing
behind a large tree, within half musket shot of the
encampment, let fly his arrows with wonderful strength
and accuracy of aim, while his voice, rising above the
din of the conflict, animated them to courage and exertion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Three arrows which he shot were avoided
by stooping. Three musket shots, which were aimed
at him, struck the tree, causing the bark and splinters
to fly about his ears, but he was unharmed. Captain
Standish devoted his special attention to this chief.
Watching his opportunity, when the arm of the savage
was exposed, in the attempt to throw another
shaft, he succeeded in striking it with a bullet. The
shattered arm dropped helpless.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The savage gazed
for a moment in apparent bewilderment and dismay,
upon the mangled and bleeding limb, and then, as if
conscious that he had fought his last battle, uttered a
peculiar and distressing cry, which was probably the
signal for retreat, and dodging from tree to tree, disappeared.</p>

<p>His warriors followed his example, and were speedily
lost in the solitude and silence of the forest.
Their flight was so instantaneous into the glooms
which surrounded them, that scarcely one moment
elapsed ere not an Indian was to be seen, and the demoniac
clamor of war gave place to the sacred quietude
of the untenanted wilderness. Captain Standish
led his heroic little band, driving before them they
knew not how many hundreds of Indians, nearly a
quarter of a mile. Then they shot off two muskets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
and gave three loud cheers, “that they might see,”
Governor Bradford writes, “that we were not afraid
of them, nor discouraged. Then the English, who
more thirsted for their conversion than their destruction,
returned to their boat without receiving any
damage.”</p>

<p>The first act of these devout men, upon returning
to their encampment, was to give thanks to God for
their great deliverance. There was a sublimity in this
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Te Deum</i>, from the lips of these exiles, as in the twilight
of the wintry morning, exposed to wind and rain,
they bowed reverently around their camp fire, which
never could have been surpassed by peals from choir
and organ, resounding through the groined arches of
the cathedrals of Saint Peter, Notre Dame or Saint
Paul.</p>

<p>The escape of the Pilgrims, unharmed, from this
shower of missiles, was indeed wonderful. The arrows
of the Indians were thrown with great force, and being
pointed with flint and bone, would, when hitting
fairly, pierce the thickest clothing. Some of them
were barbed with brass, probably obtained from some
fisherman’s vessel. When striking any unprotected
portion of the body, they would inflict a very dangerous
and painful wound. But no one was hurt. Some
overcoats which were hung up in the barricade were
pierced through and through. Arrows were sticking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
in the logs, and many were found beneath the leaves.
They collected quite a number of them, and sent
them back to England as curiosities.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the scene of this conflict, was
at what is now called Great Meadow Creek, in Eastham,
about a mile northeast from Rock Harbor. The
Pilgrims named the place The First Encounter.</p>

<p>It was indeed a gloomy morning of clouds and
rain and chill wind which now opened before these
stout-hearted wanderers. The surf dashed sullenly
upon the shore. The gale, sweeping the ocean, and
moaning through the sombre firs and pines, drove the
sheeted mist, like spectral apparitions of ill omen,
over the land and the sea. As the Pilgrims re-embarked
the rain changed to sleet. A day of suffering
and of great peril was manifestly before them.
The gale rapidly increased in violence. The billows
dashed so furiously upon the beach there was no possibility
of again landing unless they should find some
sheltered cove. The waves frequently broke into the
boat. Their garments were drenched, and clothing
and ropes were soon coated with ice. Anxiously,
hour after hour, as they were buffeted by the storm,
they searched the dim shore hoping to find some bay
or river in which they could take refuge.</p>

<p>The short winter’s day was soon drawing to a close.
Night was at hand,—night long, dark and stormy, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
an unknown sea. They were numbed and nearly
frozen with the cold. To many of them it seemed
not improbable that before the morning they would
all find a grave in the ocean. As twilight was darkening
into night, a huge billow, chasing them with
gigantic speed, broke into the boat, nearly filling it
with water, at the same time unshipping and sweeping
away their rudder. They immediately got out
two oars, and with exceeding difficulty succeeded in
steering their tempest-tossed bark. To add to their
calamities, and apparently to take from them their
last gleam of hope, just then a sudden flaw of wind
snapped their mast into three pieces, dashing their
sail into the foaming sea, and they were left at the
mercy of the billows.</p>

<p>Their pilot, who had been upon the coast before,
and who had thus far cheered them with the assurance
that there was a harbor at hand, now lost all
presence of mind, and throwing up his arms, exclaimed,
“The Lord have mercy upon us. I was
never in this place before. All that we can do is to
run the boat ashore through the breakers.” It was
insane counsel which, being followed, involved almost
certain death.</p>

<p>Some one of their number, was it their gallant
leader Miles Standish, remonstrated, shouting out in
the darkness, “If ye be men, seize your oars or we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
are all cast away.” They did so, and, with lusty arms,
on a flood tide, still guided their boat along the shore,
which was dimly seen as the breakers dashed high
over sand and rock. At last they discerned land directly
before them. Whether it were an island or a
promontory they knew not. By great exertions they
succeeded—though it was very dark and the rain fell
in torrents—in gaining the lee of the land. Here
they cast anchor in comparatively still water. But
they were afraid to leave the boat. The experience
of the past night had taught them that the woods
might be full of savages.</p>

<p>Their sufferings however from the cold, the wind
and the rain, became unendurable. A few of their
number, feeling that they should certainly perish in
the open boat, ventured ashore, where after much
difficulty they succeeded in building a fire. Though
its blaze illumining the forest, might be a beacon to
point them out to their savage foes, they piled upon it
branches and logs and, forgetting their danger, rejoiced
in the cheerful flame and the warmth. Those
in the boat could not long resist the aspect of comfort
which the fire presented. They soon also landed,
and with their axes, speedily constructed a camp to
shelter them from the rain, and a rampart of logs, behind
which, with their guns, they could protect themselves
from a large number of natives armed only
with bows and javelins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Thus ere long they found themselves in what
might be deemed, under the circumstances, comfortable
quarters. During the night the clouds were dispersed.
The morning dawned, serene and bright,
but cold. It was the morning of the Sabbath. And
these remarkable men, notwithstanding the importance
of improving every moment of time, decided,
apparently without hesitation or thought of doing
otherwise, to remain quietly in their encampment in
the religious observance of the Lord’s day. Some
may say that this was fanaticism; that a more enlightened
judgment would have taught them that the
Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath;
and that situated as they then were, it was a
work of necessity and mercy to prosecute their tour
without delay.</p>

<p>But these men believed it to be their duty to
sanctify the Sabbath by resting from all but necessary
labor. Thus believing, their decision could not but
be pleasing in the sight of God. Captain Miles
Standish, as we have mentioned, was the leader of
this expedition. The decision must have been consequently
in accordance with his views.</p>

<p>Governor Bradford, describing this painful and
perilous adventure, writes: “And though it was very
dark and rained sore, yet in the end they got under
the lee of a small island and remained there all night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
in safety. But they knew not this to be an island till
morning, but were divided in their minds. Some
would keep the boat for fear they might be among
the Indians. Others were so weak and cold, they
could not endure, but got ashore and with much ado
got a fire, all things being so wet, and the rest were
glad to come to them; for after midnight the wind
shifted to the northwest and it froze hard.</p>

<p>“But though this had been a day and night of much
trouble and danger unto them, yet God gave them a
morning of comfort and refreshing, as He usually
does to His children; for the next day was a fair,
sunshining day, and they found themselves to be on
an island, secure from the Indians, where they might
dry their stuff, fix their pieces and rest themselves,
and give God thanks for his mercies in their manifold
deliverances. And this being the last day of the
week they prepared to keep the Sabbath.”</p>

<p>In their frail camp they spent the sacred hours of
the Lord’s day, in thankgivings and supplications and
in hymning the praises of God. They named this
spot, where they had found brief refuge from the
storm, Clark’s Island, in honor of the captain of the
Mayflower.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims, having passed the Sabbath in rest
and devotion upon the island, early the next morning
repaired their shattered boat and spreading their sails
again to the wintry winds continued their tour. Soon
a large bay opened before them, partially protected
by a long sand bar from the gales and the billows of
the ocean. It was but a poor harbor at the best.
The low and dreary sand bar broke the fury of the
waves, but afforded no protection against the fierce
gales which swept the seas.</p>

<p>Cautiously our adventurers sailed around the point
of sand, every few moments dropping the lead that
they might find a channel of sufficient depth of water
to allow their vessel to enter the bay. Having found
this passage, they steered for the shore and landed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
They found here one or two streams of pure water,
several corn fields which had evidently, in former
times been cultivated by the Indians, in their rude
style of agriculture, but which, for some reason they
had abandoned. Eagerly they looked for some navigable
river, but could find none. The soil, though
not so rich as they could wish, seemed promising.
The landscape was pleasingly diversified with hills
and valleys, while the forest, in its mysterious gloom,
spread far away to unknown regions in the west.</p>

<p>The location was by no means such as they had
hoped to find. But it was far superior to any other
which had as yet presented itself. As winter was
approaching and time pressed they decided to look
no further. A party of them, well armed, marched
along the shore for a distance of eight miles, in search
of a suitable spot for their village. They selected a
spot, but saw no natives, no wigwams, and no signs
that the region had recently been inhabited.</p>

<p>Having, in their own minds, settled the important
question they spread their sails and, instead of returning
by the long circuit of the shore, which they had
traversed, pushed boldly across the bay, and in a few
hours reached the ship with their report. Without
loss of time the Mayflower weighed anchor on the
15th of December, and crossing the bay anchored on
the 16th in the shallow water of the harbor about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
mile and a half from the shore. The next day was
the Sabbath. Strong as was the temptation to land,
they all remained on board the vessel, and their
hymns of thankfulness blended with the moan of the
wintry gale as it swept through the icy shrouds.</p>

<p>Early Monday morning Miles Standish set out
with a small but well armed party to explore that part
of the country which immediately surrounded the
harbor, to decide upon the spot where they should
rear their little village of log huts. They traversed
the coast for a distance of several miles. Several
brooks of crystal water were found, but to their disappointment
no navigable river rolling down its flood
from the unknown interior. They scarcely knew
whether to be glad or sorry that they found no Indians
and no indications that the Indians then occupied
the region. Several quite extended fields were
found, where the heavily timbered forest had disappeared
and where it was evident that the Indians, in
former years, had raised their harvests of corn. At
night the party returned to the ship not having fixed
upon any spot for their settlement.</p>

<p>The next day, the 19th, another exploring party
set out moving in an opposite direction. They
divided into two companies, one to sail along the
coast in the shallop, hoping to find the mouth of some
large river. The other party landed and marched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
along the shore, examining the lay of the land, the
streams, the soil, and the timber of the forests. At
night they returned to the ship, still somewhat undecided.
They had however found one spot where
there was a small stream of very clear, sweet water,
which seemed to be well stocked with fish, and a high
hill, a little back from the shore, which could be easily
fortified, and which commanded a very extensive view
of the surrounding country and the ocean. “It had
clay, sand and shells,” writes Bradford, “for bricks,
mortar and pottery, and stone for wells and chimneys.
The sea and beach promised abundance of fish and
fowl, and four or five small running brooks brought a
supply of very sweet, fresh water.”</p>

<p>The next morning, after earnest and united prayer
for divine guidance, a still larger party of twenty was
sent on shore, more carefully to examine the spot
which had been suggested for their village. Though
it was not all they could desire, it still presented
many attractions. It was a cold December day.
They climbed the hill, and gazed with pleasure upon
a prospect which was sublime and beautiful even on
that bleak and windy day, when the boughs of the
trees were naked and when the withered leaves were
borne like snow flakes on the wintry air. They tried
to imagine its loveliness in the luxuriance and bloom
of a June morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
While they stood upon the hill, the clouds, which
all the morning had been darkening the sky, began to
increase in density and gather in blackness. The
wind rose to a gale, and the windows of heaven
seemed to be opened, as the rain fell upon them in
torrents. All unsheltered they found themselves exposed
to the fury of a New England northeast storm.
Huge billows from the ocean swept the poorly protected
harbor and broke in such surges upon the
beach that it was impossible for them to return to the
ship. They were totally unprepared for an emergency
so unexpected. Night came, a long, dark,
cold, stormy night. They sought shelter in the forest,
constructed a rude camp which but poorly sheltered
them from wind and rain, and building a large
fire, found such comfort as they could in the imperfect
warmth which it afforded. All the night of
Wednesday and all day Thursday the northeast storm
raged with fury unabated. Towards the evening of
Thursday the 21st there was a lull in the tempest, so
that the weary adventurers succeeded in working
their way back to the ship.</p>

<p>The next day was the ever-memorable Friday,
December 22d. A wintry storm, with its angry billows,
still swept the bay. The day opened upon the Pilgrims
cold, cloudy and dreary. The long and anxiously
looked for hour had now come, when the Mayflower,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the only material tie which bound them to the
Old World, was to be abandoned, and these bold men
were to be left three thousand miles from their native
shores, to struggle with all the known and unknown
perils and hardships of the wilderness. Familiar as
are the graphic words of Mrs. Hemans, the first verse
of her memorable hymn so truthfully describes the
scene which that morning was presented to the Pilgrims,
as to be worthy of transcript here:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The breaking waves dashed high<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On a stern and rock-bound coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the woods against a stormy sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their giant branches toss’d.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>At an early hour all the passengers of the Mayflower
were assembled upon the deck of their little
ship, bowed down by emotions not easily described.
Men, women and children, all were there, oppressed
by thoughts too deep for utterance. Elder Brewster
conducted their morning devotions as the wintry gale
breathed forth its requiem through the icy shrouds.
Sublime as was the hour, not one of those men of
martyr spirit could have had any true conception of
its grandeur. They could not have been conscious
that then and there they were laying the foundations
of one of the mightiest empires upon which the sun
has ever shone.</p>

<p>Their devotions being ended, boat load after boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
load left the ship which, in consequence of the shallowness
of the water, was anchored at the distance of a mile
and a half from the shore. There was a large and jagged
rock projecting into the sea, upon which a landing
was with difficulty effected. Those who first were
placed upon shore marked out a street from their point
of landing directly westward to the hill, upon each
side of which street their log huts were to be reared.</p>

<p>One of the first things, however, to be done, was
to erect a log store-house, about twenty feet square,
where they could deposit their effects, which were immediately
to be landed from the ship, and where the
women and the children could find a temporary shelter
from wind and rain.</p>

<p>In the old style of computing time, the day of
their landing was the 11th of December. For many
years the 22d day of September, new style, has been
observed as “Forefather’s Day.” It is said, however,
that December 11th, O. S., corresponds with December
21st, N. S. But when the anniversary was instituted
at Plymouth, in 1769, <em>eleven</em> days were added for
difference of style, instead of <em>ten</em>, the true difference.</p>

<p>The common house, to which we have alluded, it
is supposed was erected on the south side of what is
now called Leyden street, near the declivity of the
hill. All hands working energetically, this building
was speedily put up, with a thatched roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
Though the situation for their colony was not everything
they could desire, yet, as they prosecuted their
labors, they became better and better satisfied with
the choice which they had made. One of their number
wrote,</p>

<p>“There are here cleared lands, delicate springs,
and a sweet brook running under the hill side, with
fish in their season, where we may harbor our shallops
and boats. On the further side is much corn ground.
There is a high hill on which to plant our ordnance.
Thence we may see into the bay, and far out at sea,
and have a glimpse of the distant cape. Our greatest
labor will be the bringing of wood. What people
inhabit here we know not, as we have yet seen none.”</p>

<p>All the day of Saturday every able-bodied man
of the Pilgrims was on the shore laboring with all
possible diligence, felling trees, hewing them, and
dragging them with their own hands to the building
lots, for they had no horses or oxen. The women
also were diligently at work cooking at camp fires and
helping to stow away their goods as they were brought
on shore.</p>

<p>The whole company was divided into nineteen
families, each family to build its own log hut. For
protection against the Indians it was needful that
these huts should be clustered near together. The
captain of the Mayflower brought all the energies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
his crew into requisition in transporting the luggage
to the shore, for his provisions were fast disappearing,
and he was exceedingly anxious to set out on his return.
The distance of the ship from the land caused
much time to be lost in going and coming. For several
days a portion of the Pilgrim band remained to
lodge in the ship, while others were on the shore.
The labors of all were rendered painful and much impeded
by cold and stormy weather. Often the bay,
swept by the wintry gale, was so rough that no boat
could leave the ship, and there could be no communication
between the two parties.</p>

<p>Sunday was again with them all a day of rest and
devotion, though they were divided, some being still
on board the ship, while others were in their frail
shelters on the land. Those on shore assembled, for
their devotions, in their partially finished store-house.
Their harps must have been hung upon the willows,
and pensive must have been the strains which were
breathed from their lips as they endeavored to sing
the Lord’s songs in a strange land. As with firm but
saddened voices they sang, they were startled by the
war-whoop of the Indians in the forest. They knew
those fearful cries too well which many of them had
heard at the First Encounter.</p>

<p>Their efficient military commander, Miles Standish,
had everything arranged for such an emergency.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Instantly every man seized his musket and was at his
post. Behind their barricade of logs, they could, with
their deadly fire arms, repel almost any number of
savages approaching over the open fields with only
bows and arrows. The Indians, who had been already
taught to dread these weapons, after carefully reconnoitering
the position of the Pilgrims, vented their
rage in a few impotent yells, and, without any exposure
of their persons to the bullet, retreated into the
wilderness.</p>

<p>The next day was Christmas. With renewed diligence
the Pilgrims plied their labors. “We went on
shore,” writes Mourt, “some to fell timber, some to
saw, some to rive, and some to carry. So no man
rested all that day.”</p>

<p>As we have mentioned, there were nineteen families,
but they differed considerably in size. The single
men joined themselves to some of these families.
The lots of land assigned to these families differed in
size, according to the number of the household. To
each individual person there was allotted about eight
feet in breadth by fifty in length. This would make
but about four hundred square feet for each one.
Thus, a family of six persons would have a lot but
forty-eight feet wide by fifty deep. This seems an
incredibly small amount of land for each homestead,
when the Pilgrims had the whole continent of North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
America before them. The explanation is probably
to be found in the fact that it was necessary for them
to place their houses as near together as possible;
that, with neither horses, oxen, or any other beasts of
burden, it was but a small portion of land which any
one man could cultivate; and, again, if any one wished
for more land, there were fields all around him, entirely
free, and no one would dispute his title deed.
The homestead lots were so arranged as to make the
little cluster of huts a fortress, protected by their cannon,
where their whole force could be instantly rallied
for the public defense. Towards night of Christmas
day, the yells of evidently unfriendly savages
were heard in the depths of the forest. This caused
every man to seize his musket and place himself in
the attitude of defense. The wary savages, however,
while uttering these impotent menaces, still kept themselves
carefully concealed.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the 26th of December, ushered in such
a storm of rain that those on shore could do no work,
and the gale so roughened the bay that those on board
the ship could not venture an attempt to land. The
next day the storm abated, and every available man
was at work. As it seemed very evident that the
savages were hostile, and it was apprehended that
they might be gathering for a general assault, it was
deemed necessary, notwithstanding the pressing need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
of dwellings, that all should go to work upon the
hill, in the construction of a rude fort and platform
for their ordnance. The vestiges of this fortification
are still visible on the Burial Hill, where the guns
could sweep with grape shot the approaches to their
village. It was hoped that the thunders of these formidable
weapons of war, followed by the carnage they
could inflict, should the savages approach in great
numbers, would overwhelm them with terror.</p>

<p>The weather, during the remainder of the week,
continued very unfavorable, it being cold, wet and
stormy. Still the works on the land slowly advanced.
The savages, without showing themselves, continued
to hover around, and the smokes of great fires were
seen, apparently at the distance of about six or seven
miles, indicating that the Indians, in large numbers,
were gathering around them.</p>

<p>The last day of the year 1620 came, sombre and
sad. It was the Sabbath. Many were sick. All
were dejected. Wintry dreariness frowned over earth
and sea. Howling savages filled the forest. The
provisions of the Pilgrims were very scanty. The
Mayflower was soon to leave them, to contend, a feeble
band, against apparently hostile elements, and
against the far more formidable hostility of savage
men. To meet these perils the Pilgrims could number
but forty-one men. Sickness had already commenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
its ravages, and of these men, within three
months, twenty-one died. The chances that such a
colony could long be preserved from extinction, must
have seemed almost infinitely small. As usual, the
Pilgrims rested from labor, and devoted the day, some
on shore, some in the ship, to prayer and praise. On
this day the Pilgrims solemnly named their little village
Plymouth, in grateful remembrance of the kindness
which they had received from the people of Plymouth,
in England.</p>

<p>Monday morning, the first day of the new year,
dawned propitiously upon these bold-hearted exiles.
A cloudless sky and genial atmosphere invited them
to labor. It was still necessary to be ever prepared
for an attack from their unseen foes. With no little
solicitude, while urging forward their work, they
watched the moving columns of smoke, which day by
day rose from the distant wilderness, and the gleam
of the fires, which by night illumined the horizon, indicating
the movement and position of the Indians.
During Tuesday and Wednesday these fires seemed
to increase in numbers. They were thus led to infer
that the savages were collecting in large numbers
from distant parts, and were making careful preparation
for a general and simultaneous assault upon the
feeble colony.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning, the 4th of January, Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Miles Standish, who might be truly called the
“bravest of the brave,” took with him four men, well
armed, and boldly plunged into the forest, intending
to find the Indians at their rendezvous, and if possible,
to open friendly relations with them. Adopting
every precaution to avoid falling into an ambuscade,
he rapidly pushed forward several miles into the pathless
wilderness, threading gloomy ravines, crossing
rivulets, and traversing sublime forests. The wary
Indians had undoubtedly their scouts stationed to give
warning of any approach of the white men; for Captain
Standish could not catch sight of a single one of
the savages, though he found several of their deserted
wigwams, and even the still glowing embers of their
camp fires. The adventurers were also disappointed
in finding that the woods seemed destitute of game.
Upon their return, at the close of the afternoon, they
shot one solitary eagle, whose flesh the Pilgrims, in
their half famished state, pronounced to be “excellent
meat, hardly to be discerned from mutton.”</p>

<p>Friday and Saturday passed away without any
event of importance occurring, while all hands were
diligently at work. Another Sabbath of rest, the 7th
of January, dawned upon these toil-worn men and
women. The sun, of Monday, the 8th, rose in a
cloudless sky. All bent themselves eagerly to work.
By some unaccountable oversight no small fishhooks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
had been brought with them. Thus, though the harbor
and the brook apparently abounded with fishes,
they could not be taken. The shallop, however, was
sent out to explore the coast, ascertain where fishes
could be found, and supplied with apparatus for
taking seals, which were seen in large numbers.
In the evening the boat returned, a gale having in
the mean time arisen which greatly endangered its
safety. The crew had taken three large seals, and
in some way, perhaps by spearing, had got an excellent
codfish.</p>

<p>One of their number, Francis Billington, had, a
few days before, climbed a tree upon the top of a hill,
whence he saw, about two miles southwest from the
town, a large body of water, which was either a lake
or an arm of the sea, he could not tell which. He
started to-day, with a companion, to visit it, and found
two large lakes of crystal water, nearly connected
together. One was about six miles in circuit, embellished
with a small, luxuriantly wooded island. The
other they estimated to be about three miles in circumference.
They both abounded with fish and water
fowl, and apparently an unfailing stream of water,
which is now called Town Brook, issued from one of
the lakes and emptied into the harbor a little south
of the rock upon which the Pilgrims landed. Several
Indian houses, but all uninhabited, were found upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the margin of these sheets of water, which were essentially
one lake.</p>

<p>“This beautiful pond, so accurately described,
bears the appropriate name of Billington Sea. In the
first century it was called Fresh Lake. It is about
two miles southwest from the town, and in it are two
small islands. It is now, as at first, embosomed in a
wilderness of woods. The eagle still sails over it,
and builds in the branches of the surrounding forest.
Here the loon cries, and leaves her eggs on the shore
of the smaller island. Here too, the beautiful wood-duck
finds a sequestered retreat; and the fallow deer,
mindful of their ancient haunts, still resort to it to
drink and to browse on its margin.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday all hands
were busy in their out-door work. The store-house,
or, as they called it, the Common House, was nearly
finished and thatched. The cold, damp weather hindered
them very much, so that they could seldom
work more than half of the time. Friday morning
dawned pleasantly, but about noon the clouds gathered,
and the chill rain began to fall, and an increasing
gale moaned through the tree tops. Four men
had gone out into the woods in the morning to gather
tall dry grass for thatching. In the afternoon two of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
them returned, and said that in some way they had
lost sight of their companions. They had searched
for them in vain; and though they had hallooed and
shouted as loud as they could, they could hear nothing
from them. Intense solicitude was felt for them, and
a party of four or five men were immediately dispatched
to search in the direction in which they were
last seen. After an absence of a few hours they
returned, at the close of the day, not having been able
to discover any traces of the lost, though they found
many indications that the Indians were lurking around.
The long, stormy wintry night passed slowly away,
and still there were no tidings of the wanderers. In
the morning twelve men, well armed, probably under
the leadership of Captain Miles Standish, set out for
a more extended exploration. It was well known
that Captain Standish would fail in nothing which
mortal energy or courage could accomplish. The
prayers of the sorrowing band accompanied them as
they plunged into the forest. After a long and careful
search, in which they could find no trace whatever
of the lost men, they returned at night in deep dejection
to their companions. All the Pilgrims gathered
around them, men, women and children, to hear the
account of their unsuccessful search.</p>

<p>While thus assembled they were startled by a shout
in the distance, and looking up, to their inexpressible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
joy, saw the two men emerging from the forest. They
ran to meet the wanderers, John Goodman and Peter
Brown, whose apparition was as life from the dead.
Their tattered garments and emaciate cheeks testified
to the hardships which they had endured. The
following was the account which they gave of their
adventure:</p>

<p>As they were gathering some long grass, for thatching,
about a mile from the village, probably on the
banks of Town Brook, they saw a pond in the distance,
perhaps Murdock’s Pond, and repaired to it. Upon
the margin of the pond they found a deer drinking.
Two dogs they had with them sprang after the deer,
and pursued it eagerly into the forest. The men followed,
hoping that the dogs would seize the deer, and
that thus they might be able to capture so rich a prize.
As, led by the baying of the hounds, they followed
the deer in its windings and turnings, they became
bewildered and lost in the pathless wilds which they
had penetrated. All the afternoon they wandered in
vain seeking some clew to lead them back to their
home.</p>

<p>Night, dismal night, lowered over them with clouds,
a rising gale, and snow mingled with rain. They had
no axes with which to construct a shelter. They
could find no cave or hollow tree in which to take
refuge. Weary, footsore and starving, and with no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
weapon but a small sickle with which they had been
cutting thatch, they heard the howling of wolves around
them, and other strange cries from wild beasts, of
they knew not what ferocity. Their only protection
seemed to be to climb into a tree. They tried it.
The keen wintry blast so pierced their thin clothing
that they could not endure the cold. Death by freezing
would be inevitable.</p>

<p>The blackness of Egyptian darkness was now
around them. They also heard a fearful roaring of
wild beasts, which was undoubtedly the howling of
wolves, but which they supposed to be the roar of
lions. They stood at the root of the trees all the night
long, exercising as they could to keep themselves
warm, ever ready to spring into the branches should
danger approach. They were compelled to hold one
of their dogs by the neck, he was so eager to rush in
pursuit of the beasts whose cries excited him.</p>

<p>The long winter night at length gave way to the
gloom of a stormy morning. Half frozen and starving,
and expecting to perish in the wilderness, these
lost men resumed their search for home. They waded
through swamps, forded streams, encountered ponds,
struggled through thickets which tore clothing and
skin. At last they came to a hill. Climbing one of
the tallest trees, they saw the ocean in the distance,
and, to their inexpressible joy, recognized the harbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
of Plymouth, by two little islands which dotted its surface.
The sight reanimated their drooping minds
and bodies. All day long, in the extreme of exhaustion,
they tottered on their way, until just before nightfall
they reached their home. The feet of one of these
men, John Goodman, were so swollen that they were
compelled to cut off his shoes.</p>

<p>The work of building had advanced slowly. The
days were short, cold and stormy. Nearly all were
enfeebled by toil and exposure, while some were seriously
sick. Both Governor Carver and Mr. Bradford,
his successor in office, were prostrate with fevers.
They were on beds in the Common House, where cots
had been arranged on the floor for the sick, as near
one to another as they could be placed. Though
many of the Pilgrims were still in the Mayflower, the
majority lodged on shore.</p>

<p>The Common House was so far finished, nearly
all of its roof being thatched, that it afforded protection
from the snow and rain, while its thick walls of
logs shut off the piercing wind, and a cheerful fire
blazed upon the stone hearth.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, January 14th, about six
o’clock, the wind blowing almost a gale, they were
appalled by the cry of “fire.” The thatch of grass,
dry as tinder, touched by a spark, was in a blaze. All
the ammunition and most of the arms had been brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
on shore and deposited in the store-house. Its loss
would expose them, defenceless, to the tomahawk of
the Indian. Nearly all of their scanty supply of food
was there. Without it starvation was inevitable. The
people in the ship saw the smoke and the flame, but
the tide was out, and they could not reach the shore.
Soon, however, the tide came in, the gale abated, and
a boat load cautiously advanced to the land, where
they had all proposed to pass the Sabbath together,
the majority of the company being then on shore.
Upon landing they were cheered with the tidings that
the lost men were found, and that the fire, which had
been extinguished, was accidental.</p>

<p>Monday, the 15th of January, opened upon the
way-worn exiles with another storm of wind and rain,
so that those on shipboard could not leave the vessel,
and those on shore could do no work. The next
three days, however, were pleasant, each morning
dawning upon them with rare loveliness. Their hearts
were cheered, and they pressed forward in their labors
with great vigor. The terrible fright which the
fire caused taught them that they must place their
store-house apart from the other buildings, and where
there would be no exposure to conflagration. They,
therefore, went immediately to work to put up a shed
for this purpose, intending to reserve the building
already erected as a common lodging house until the
separate huts could be reared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Friday opened pleasantly; but at noon it began
to rain, which prevented any out-door work. Towards
evening the storm abated, and John Goodman, whose
feet had been sadly crippled by his exposure in the
woods, hobbled out a little way from the village for
exercise, accompanied by a small spaniel. Two half
famished wolves came leaping from the forest in pursuit
of his dog. The terrified animal ran between
his master’s legs for protection. Mr. Goodman caught
up a heavy stick, and for some time kept the ferocious
beasts at bay. They kept at a little distance, just out
of reach of his club, gnashing upon him with their
sharp and glistening teeth in most dramatic style. But
ere long the wolves, to Mr. Goodman’s intense relief,
turned away and rushed howling into the woods.</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday the 20th of January, they
completed their shed for a store-house, and nearly all
of their company came to the land. On Sunday, 21st,
there was a general assembling of the Pilgrims in the
Common House, as their temple, where their revered
and beloved pastor, Rev. Mr. Brewster, conducted divine
worship. This was the first Sabbath on which
the Pilgrims as a body had been able to meet together
in their new home.</p>

<p>Monday, 22d, was a fair day, and during the whole
week the weather continued propitious. All were
busy, bringing boat loads of freight from the ship, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
packing away their provisions and other goods in the
store-house. Two boats were employed in bringing
the luggage on shore, but it was slow work, in consequence
of the distant anchorage of the Mayflower.
As they had neither ox, mule nor horse, all the articles
had to be carried by hand from the landing-place
to their destination many rods distant from the shore.</p>

<p>The next week was ushered in by a storm of
piercing wind and sleet. To add to its gloom, on its
first day, Rose, the young and beautiful wife of Captain
Standish, died. But care, sickness, death now
came in such swift succession as to leave the survivors
but little time to weep over the dead. The two
succeeding days the weather was so inclement that
no work could be done. Not very far from the ship’s
place of anchorage there was a small island. On
Wednesday morning those on board the ship saw two
savages walking upon the island. What they were
doing no one could tell. They were seen but for a
few moments, when they retired out of sight in the
forest.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, February 4th, a fearful gale
swept the bay. It was the most severe storm the
Pilgrims had yet encountered. For some time great
apprehensions were felt lest the ship should be torn
from her moorings and dashed upon the shore. The
huts, which they were erecting for their dwellings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
were of unhewn logs, the interstices being filled with
clay. The wind and the rain washed out this clay,
causing very serious damage. Much of the thatching
also, as yet but insecurely fastened, was whirled into
the air by the tempest, like autumn leaves. During
the whole of the week the weather continued so cold
and stormy that but little work could be done.</p>

<p>In consequence of the increasing sickness, it had
been found necessary to put up a small house for a
hospital. On Friday, the 9th, the thatched roof of
this building took fire from a spark. Fortunately the
wet weather had so dampened the straw that the fire
was extinguished without doing much damage.
Where wood was the only fuel, ever throwing up a
shower of sparks, a thatch of straw, often as dry as
tinder, seemed to invite conflagration. Thus their
little hamlet, of clustered log houses, was peculiarly
exposed to the peril of fire. That afternoon five wild
geese were shot, which afforded a very grateful repast
to the sick people. A good fat deer was also found,
which had just been killed by the Indians, and which,
for some inexplicable reason they had left, having cut
off its horns. It is possible that the wary savages,
keeping a sharp look out, had seen some of the white
men approaching, and had fled. A wolf had, however,
anticipated the Pilgrims, and was daintily feeding
upon the tender venison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
Another week came, with great discouragement
of stormy weather, and with increasing sickness.
The men worked to much disadvantage, everything
having to be done with their own hands. The logs,
generally about a foot in thickness and nearly twenty
feet long, had often to be dragged from very inconvenient
distances. This was labor which could not
safely be performed with clothing drenched with rain
and pierced with the wintry gale. Often whole days
were lost in which no work could be done.</p>

<p>Friday, February 16th, was a fair day. It was,
however, very cold, and the ground was frozen hard.
In the afternoon one of the company took his gun and
went into the woods a fowling. He had gone about
a mile and a half from the plantation, and had concealed
himself in some reeds, which fringed a creek,
watching for wild geese or ducks, when, to his astonishment,
twelve Indians appeared, walking towards
the plantation, in single file and in perfect silence.
Almost breathless he crouched down beneath his covert
until they had disappeared, and then, with the
utmost caution, hastened back to give the alarm.</p>

<p>The Indians, it would seem, were out upon a reconnoitering
tour. They were very careful not to
show themselves at the settlement, though they came
sufficiently near to take some tools which Captain
Standish and Francis Cooke, who had been at work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
in the woods, had left behind them, with no apprehension
that there were any prowlers so near. The alarm
caused the whole Pilgrim band immediately to rally
under arms. There was, however, nothing more seen
of the savages. But that night a large fire was discovered
near the spot where the twelve Indians had
made their appearance.</p>

<p>It was now deemed important to have a more perfect
military organization, to meet the dangers impending
from the manifestly unfriendly spirit of the Indians.
The Pilgrims, in their weakened state, were
but poorly prepared for any general assault. On Saturday
morning, the 19th of February, they all assembled
in council, and Captain Standish was invested
with almost dictatorial powers as military commander.
With characteristic sagacity and energy he undertook
the responsible duties thus devolving upon him.
While they were assembled in consultation, two Indians
appeared upon a small eminence, then called
Strawberry Hill, on the other side of Town Brook,
about a quarter of a mile southwest from the village,
and made signs to the Pilgrims to come to them.</p>

<p>It was not improbable that they were a decoy, and
that hundreds of armed warriors were concealed in
the forest behind, ready, at a concerted signal, to
raise the terrible war-whoop and rush upon their victims
with javelin and tomahawk. There were not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
score of Pilgrims able to bear arms. What could they
do to repel such an onset. It was an awful hour, in
view of the possibilities which were before them. The
women and children huddled together in terror. It
seemed probable to them that the Indians had long
been gathering and making preparations for this assault,
and that within an hour their husbands and
fathers would be slain, and that they would be at the
mercy of the savages.</p>

<p>The perilous duty of advancing to meet the savages,
and of thus being perhaps the first to fall into
the ambush, Captain Standish took upon himself.
Selecting Mr. Stephen Hopkins, one of the most illustrious
of the Pilgrims, and a man alike distinguished
for his prudence and his bravery, to accompany
him, he advanced, entirely unarmed, in token of
his friendly disposition, across the brook. Mr. Hopkins
carried his gun. When they reached the foot of
the eminence the gun was laid upon the ground, as an
additional sign of peace, and they both moved forward
to meet the tufted warriors. The conduct of the savages
was often quite inexplicable. They were as capricious
as children. On this occasion, as Captain
Standish and Mr. Hopkins slowly ascended the hill,
the two Indians upon the summit suddenly turned
and fled precipitately down the other side of the hill
into the dense forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
It was a very bold act, it seems to us now a very
imprudent one, for these two unarmed men, still to
advance to the summit of the hill, thus exposing themselves
to fall into an Indian ambush. They however
cautiously moved on; when they reached the top of the
hill not an Indian was in sight, but they heard the noise
of a great multitude retreating through the forest.
They were of course greatly perplexed to judge what
all this senseless conduct could mean. One thing,
however, was certain; the Indians were not disposed
to establish friendly relations with the new comers.</p>

<p>Captain Standish made immediate and vigorous
preparation for a war of defense. It was very evident
to him that, though they might be surrounded by
cruel, treacherous and inveterate foes, they had but
little to fear from the intelligence or military ability
of their enemies. He had immediately brought on
shore, and mounted on the platform, which he had arranged
for them on the hill, three guns. One was
called a minion, with a bore three and a quarter inches
in diameter. Another was a saker, about four inches
in bore. The third, called a base, was but little larger
than a musket, having a bore but one and a quarter
inches in diameter. The heaviest gun weighed about
a thousand pounds, and carried a ball about four
pounds in weight. This important work was all accomplished
by Wednesday, February 21st. It appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
that the officers of the Mayflower assisted efficiently
in the operation. The united company then
dined luxuriously upon a very fat goose, a fat crane,
a mallard,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> and a dried neats tongue. And so we
were kindly and friendly together.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Sunday, the 3d of March, came. It was a lovely
day. The severity of winter had passed. A dreadful
winter to the Pilgrims, indeed it had been. During
the month of February seventeen of their number
had died. Eight had died during the month of January.
In burying the dead it had been deemed necessary
carefully to conceal their graves lest the Indians,
in counting them, should ascertain how greatly they
had been weakened. Governor Bradford, in recording
these disastrous events, writes:</p>

<p>“After they had provided a place for their goods,
or common store, which were long in unlading for
want of boats, foulness of winter weather and sickness
of divers, and begun some small cottages for their
habitation, they met, as time would admit, and consulted
of laws and orders, both for their civil and
military government, as the necessities of their occasion
did require.</p>

<p>“In these hard and difficult beginnings they found
some discontents and murmurings arise among some,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
and mutinous speeches and carriage in others. But
they were soon quelled and overcome by the wisdom,
patience, and just and equal carriage of things, by the
Governor and better part, which clave faithfully together
in the main. But that which was most sad
and lamentable was that, in two or three months’ time
half of their company died; especially in January and
February, being the depth of winter, and wanting
houses and other comforts; being infected with scurvy
and other diseases, which their long voyage and inaccommodate
condition had brought upon them; so as
there died sometimes two or three of a day, that of
one hundred and odd persons, scarce fifty remained.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>“And of these, in the time of most distress, there
were but six or seven sound persons who, to their
great commendation be it spoken, spared no pains,
night nor day, but with abundance of toil and hazard
of their own health, fetched them wood and made them
fires, dressed their meat, made their beds, washed
their loathsome clothes, clothed and unclothed them;
in a word, did all the homely and necessary offices
for them which dainty and quesie stomachs cannot
endure to hear named; and all this willingly and
cheerfully, without any grudging in the least, shewing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
herein their true love unto their friends and brethren.
A rare example, and worthy to be remembered.</p>

<p>“Two of these seven were Mr. William Brewster,
their reverend Elder, and Miles Standish, their Captain
and military commander, unto whom myself and
many others were much beholden in our low and sick
condition.</p>

<p>“And yet the Lord so upheld these persons as,
in this general calamity, they were not at all infected
with sickness or lameness. And what I have said of
these I may say of many others who died in this general
visitation, and others yet living, that whilst they
had health, yea or any strength continuing, they were
not wanting to any that had need of them. And I
doubt not but that their recompense is with the
Lord.</p>

<p>“But I may not here pass by another remarkable
passage, never to be forgotten. As this calamity fell
among the passengers that were to be left here to
plant, and were hasted ashore and made to drink
water, that the seamen might have the more beer.
And one (Mr. Bradford) in his sickness desiring but
a small can of beer, it was answered that if he were
their own father he should have none. The disease
began to fall amongst them also, so as almost half of
their company died before they went away, and many
of their officers and lustiest men, as the boatswain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
gunner, three quartermasters, the cook and others.
At which the Master was somewhat strucken, and
sent to the sick, on shore, and told the Governor he
would send beer for them that had need of it, though
he drank water, homeward bound.</p>

<p>“But now amongst his company there was far
another kind of carriage in this misery than among
the passengers. For they that beforetime had been
boon companions in drinking and jollity in the time
of their health and welfare, began now to desert one
another in this calamity, saying that they would not
hazard their lives for them; they should be infected
by coming to them in their cabins. And so, after
they came to die by it, would do little or nothing for
them, but if they died, let them die.</p>

<p>“But such of the passengers as were yet aboard
shewed them what mercy they could, which made
some of their hearts relent, as the boatswain, who
was a proud young man, and would often curse and
scoff at the passengers. But when he grew weak
they had compassion on him and helped him. Then
he confessed he did not deserve it at their hands; he
had abused them in word and deed. ‘O,’ saith he,
‘you, I now see, show your love, like Christians indeed,
one to another. But we let one another lie and
die like dogs.’</p>

<p>“Another lay cursing his wife, saying if it had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
been for her he had never come this unlucky voyage,
and anon cursing his fellows, saying he had done this
and that for some of them; he had spent so much
and so much amongst them, and they were now
weary of him, and did not help him having need.
Another gave his companion all he had, if he died, to
help him in his weakness. He went and got a little
spice, and made him a mess of meat once or twice;
and because he died not as soon as he expected, he
went among his fellows and swore the rogue would
cozen him; he would see him choked before he made
him any more meat; and yet the poor fellow died before
morning.”</p>

<p>As we have mentioned, the third of March dawned
beautifully, sunny and mild, upon the weary Pilgrims.
The birds sang sweetly, and everything indicated
the speedy return of the much-longed-for summer
weather. But towards noon the clouds gathered,
the rain fell in torrents, and they were visited with
one of the severest tempests, accompanied by the
loudest thunder, any of them had ever witnessed.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 7th of March, a company of
five, all well armed, accompanied Governor Carver to
the great lakes, to which they had given the name of
Billington Sea. These waters abounded with fish,
and it would seem that by this time they had devised
some plan by which to take them. They found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
woods through which they passed filled with well-beaten
deer tracks, indicating the presence of large
numbers of that species of game, though they did not
chance to meet with any. Many water fowl were also
disporting upon the placid waters of the lake, some
of very beautiful plumage. The weather was so warm
and the season so advanced that some garden seeds
were sown on this day.</p>

<p>Another week passed, during which their work
proceeded very slowly in consequence of their enfeebled
numbers and the claims of the sick on the services
of the few who were well. Friday, the 16th,
was a fair, warm day. Every one felt the situation
of the colony to be perilous in the extreme. The
sailors of the Mayflower were suffering alike with the
Pilgrims on the land. There were but seven men
who, in case of an attack, which was hourly anticipated,
could present any efficient resistance. The
onset of a hundred armed warriors (and a thousand
might come) would sweep away their little village like
an Alpine avalanche. The responsibility for the public
defense thus resting upon Captain Standish, was
very weighty. Every individual had his post of duty
assigned him, that there should be no confused or
embarrassed action in the alarm. Captain Standish
had this morning assembled all who were capable of
bearing arms in the northern part of their little street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
to complete their military preparations, when, to their
surprise, they saw a solitary savage approaching from
the south.</p>

<p>Without the slightest indication of embarrassment
or hesitation he strode along, entered the street,
and advancing boldly to the rendezvous, saluted the
Pilgrims with the words, “Welcome Englishmen.”
His only clothing consisted of a leather belt around
his waist, to which was attached a fringe, about ten
inches long. He had a bow and two arrows. He
was a powerful man, tall and straight, with very black
hair, long behind, but cut short over the forehead. In
broken English he told them that his name was Samoset,
and that he came from the Island of Monhegan,
between the Kennebec and Penobscot rivers, about
twelve miles from the shore.</p>

<p>This island had for many years been a favorite resort
for the English fishermen. From them he had
learned a little English, and knew the names of many
of the captains who annually visited those waters.
Seeing the Mayflower in the harbor, he supposed it
to be a fishing vessel, and thus, without any fear, approached
the men.</p>

<p>Samoset affected to be very free and unembarrassed
in his carriage. He declared himself to be
one of the chiefs of the tribe, and assumed to be perfectly
informed respecting the whole adjacent country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
its tribes and their strength. He called for beer,
and seemed disposed to make himself very much at
home, entering the houses and spying out with
an eagle eye all the works around him. Captain
Standish was not disposed to have his weakness exposed
to this perhaps wary and treacherous savage,
who might have entered the village merely as a spy,
in the interest of the Indian warriors who were lurking
in the woods around. To make him a little more
presentable to the families, a large horseman’s coat
was placed upon him. Instead of being allowed to
wander about at will, he was entrusted to the keeping
of Mr. Hopkins, who took him to his hut and fed
him with the utmost hospitality.</p>

<p>From Samoset they learned three very important
facts. The first was that the Indians, all along the
coast, were greatly and justly exasperated against the
white men, by the treachery of one Captain Hunt.
This infamous man, while trading with the Indians,
had inveigled twenty-seven men on board his ship,
and then, closing the hatches upon them, had carried
them off where most of them had never been heard
of more. The wretch took these poor kidnapped Indians
to Spain, and sold them as slaves, for one hundred
dollars each. The untutored savages who, before
this, were friendly, being thus robbed of their
kindred, knew no better than to wreak their vengeance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
upon any white man whom they might encounter.</p>

<p>Not long after this a French ship was wrecked on
Cape Cod. The savages, burning with a desire for
vengeance, massacred all but three or four of the
crew, whom they reserved as prisoners. Everything
that had been saved from the wreck they divided
among themselves. Hence, perhaps, the iron kettle
which the Pilgrims had found in one of their exploring
tours. The captives were sent from one tribe
to another, into the interior, that there might be no
possibility of a rescue. One of these captives, probably
a thoughtful, perhaps a religious man, learned
their language, and told them that “God was angry
with them, and in punishment would destroy them
and give their country to another people.” They replied
that “they were so numerous that God would
not be able to destroy them.”</p>

<p>But it so happened that ere long a terrible plague,
resembling the yellow fever, broke out among the Indians,
sweeping them off by thousands. The whole
country became nearly depopulated. In these disastrous
days the Indians remembered the words of the
Frenchman, and began to fear that the white man’s
God was really taking vengeance upon them. When
the Mayflower arrived they feared that another people
had come to take possession of their lands. Hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
the hostile attitude which had been assumed, and the
attack at the First Encounter. Samoset seemed to
know all about this attack, and said that it was made
by a tribe on the Cape called Nausites.</p>

<p>It appears that the plague, above referred to,
swept the whole seaboard, from the mouth of the
Penobscot River to Narraganset Bay. Some tribes
became nearly extinct. The Massachusetts tribe was
reduced, it is said, from thirty thousand to three hundred
fighting men. Captain Dermer, who visited the
coast a year before the landing of the Pilgrims, writes:</p>

<p>“I passed along the coast where I found some
ancient plantations, not long since populous, now
utterly void. In other places a remnant remains, but
not free of sickness. Their disease was the plague,
for we might perceive the sores of some that had escaped,
who described the spots of such as usually
die.”</p>

<p>Morton writes in his New English Canaan: “Some
few years before the English came to inhabit in New
Plymouth, the hand of God fell heavily upon the natives,
with such a mortal stroke that they died on
heaps. In a place where many inhabited there hath
been but one left alive to tell what became of the rest.
And the bones and skulls upon the several places of
their habitations made such a spectacle, after my
coming into these parts, that as I travelled in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
forest, near the Massachusetts, it seemed to me a
new-found Golgotha.”</p>

<p>In view of these facts it was stated, in the Great
Patent of New England, granted by King James, on
the 3d of November, 1820, “We have been further
given certainly to know, that within these late years
there hath, by God’s visitation, reigned a wonderful
plague amongst the savages there heretofore inhabiting,
in a manner to the utter destruction, devastation
and depopulation of that whole territory, so as there
is not left, for many leagues together, in a manner,
any that do claim or challenge any kind of interest
therein. Whereby we, in our judgment, are persuaded
and satisfied that the appointed time is come in
which Almighty God, in his great goodness and
bounty towards us and our people, hath thought fit
and determined, that these large and goodly territories,
deserted as it were by their natural inhabitants,
should be possessed and enjoyed by such of our subjects
and people as shall, by his mercy and favor, and
by his powerful arm, be directed and conducted
thither.”</p>

<p>All the afternoon was spent in earnest communication
with Samoset. He told them that the Nausites,
by whom they had been attacked, numbered
about one hundred souls. There was a powerful
tribe, called the Wampanoags, upon the shores of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
what is now called Bristol Bay. Their chief, Massasoit,
was so powerful that he exercised a sort of supremacy
over many of the tribes in the vicinity.
There was another numerous tribe, not far from the
Wampanoags, called the Narragansets. Samoset
does not seem to have known, or if so, was not willing
to tell the number of Indians lurking in the woods
around the Pilgrim settlement. The mystery of their
conduct was, however, in some degree revealed, when
the Pilgrims were informed that the Indians, with
their priests, had met in a dark swamp, in a general
pow-wow, hoping by their curses and incantations to
destroy the white men.</p>

<p>On the whole, the information communicated by
Samoset was encouraging. It led them to hope that
their foes were not so numerous as they feared, that
they regarded, with superstitious dread, the God of
the white man, and that they were rather disposed to
rely upon witchcraft and incantations, in their warfare
upon the new-comers, than upon more material and
dangerous weapons. Had the Indians known what
ravages death was making in the huts of the Pilgrims,
they would have felt assured that their magic arts
were signally successful.</p>

<p>As night approached, Captain Standish was quite
anxious to get rid of his suspicious guest. But Samoset
manifested no disposition to leave. He however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
consented to go on board the ship to pass the night.
They went down to the shallop. But the wind was
so high that it was not deemed prudent to encounter
the high sea, and they returned to Mr. Stephen Hopkins’
house, where Samoset was lodged, and carefully
though secretly watched.</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday, the 17th, early in the
morning, Samoset withdrew, to go, as he said, to visit
the great sagamore, Massasoit. He received a present
of a knife, a bracelet and a ring, promising to
return in a few days, bringing with him some of Massasoit’s
people, and some beaver skins to sell.</p>

<p>Sunday, the 18th, was another mild and lovely
day. As the colonists were assembling for the Sabbath
devotions, Samoset again made his appearance,
with five tall Indians in his train. They were all
dressed in deer skins, fitting closely to the body.
The most of them had also a panther’s skin, or some
similar furs on his arm, for sale. As Captain Standish
did not deem it safe to allow any armed savages
to enter the town, he made a previous arrangement
with Samoset, that whoever of the Indians he might
bring with him, should leave their bows and arrows a
quarter of a mile distant from this village. This arrangement
was faithfully observed. Samoset also
brought back the tools, which, it will be remembered,
had been carried away by the Indians. Mourt, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
his Relation, describes, in the following language, the
appearance of these strange visitors:</p>

<p>“They had, most of them, long hosen (leggins)
up to their groins, close made; and above their groins
to the waist, another leather. They were altogether
like the Irish trousers. They are of complexion like
our English gipseys; no hair, or very little, on their
faces; on their heads, long hair to their shoulders,
only cut before; some trussed up before with a
feather, broadwise like a fan; another a fox tail hanging
out. Some of them had their faces painted black,
from the forehead to the chin, four or five fingers
broad; others after other fashions, as they liked.”</p>

<p>The Pilgrims, anxious to win the confidence and
friendship of the natives, received these savages with
the utmost kindness, and very hospitably entertained
them. They seemed to relish very highly the food
which was set before them, and manifested their satisfaction
and friendship by singing hilariously, and
performing the most grotesque antics in a dance. It
was Sunday, and this was not pleasing to these devout
exiles. They told Samoset that they could not enter
into any traffic on that day; but that if he and his
companions would withdraw and return upon the morrow,
or any other day of the week, they would purchase,
not only all the furs they had with them, but
any others which they might bring. Each one was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
made happy with a present of some article which to
him was of almost priceless value. They all retired
except Samoset. He refused to go, asserting, and as
the Pilgrims thought, feigning, that he was sick. He
therefore remained until Wednesday. Each of these
men carried his commissariat stores with him, consisting
of a small bag of the meal of parched corn.
Mr. Gookin, in an article in the Massachusetts Historical
Collection, writes:</p>

<p>“The Indians make a certain sort of meal of
parched maize, which they call <em>nokake</em>. It is so sweet,
toothsome and hearty that an Indian will travel many
days with no other food but this meal, which he eateth
as he needs, and after it drinketh water. And
for this end, when they travel a journey or go a hunting,
they carry this <em>nokake</em> in a basket or bag, for their
use.”</p>

<p>Roger Williams says, “Nokake, or parched meal,
is a ready, very wholesome food, which they eat with
a little water, hot or cold. I have travelled with near
two hundred of them at once, near a hundred miles
through the woods, every man carrying a little basket
of this at his back, and sometimes in a hollow leather
girdle about his middle, sufficient for a man three or
four days. With this ready provision and their bows
and arrows, they are ready for war or travel at an
hour’s warning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
The corn was usually parched in hot ashes, and
then, after having the ashes carefully brushed off, was
beat to powder. About a gill of this mixed with
water, taken three times a day, gave them sufficient
nourishment. With no other food than this, a man
would often travel through the woods four or five days,
carrying a very heavy burden upon his back.</p>

<p>When the Mayflower was leaving England, a man
by the name of John Billington, uninvited, with two
ungovernable boys, joined the company. He proved
to be a very uncongenial companion. Governor
Bradford, writing of him, said: This Billington was
one of the profanest among us. He came from London,
and I know not by what friends, was shuffled
into our company.” Again, Governor Bradford wrote
to Mr. Cushman, in June, 1625, “Billington still rails
against you, and threatens to arrest you, I know not
wherefore. He is a knave, and so will live and die.”
In “Mourts’ Narrative,” under date of December 5th,
he writes:</p>

<p>“This day, through God’s mercy, we escaped a
great danger by the foolishness of a boy, one of Billington’s
sons, who, in his father’s absence, had got
gunpowder, and had shot off a piece or two and made
squibs; and there being a fowling-piece charged in
his father’s cabin, shot her off in the cabin.” There
was half a keg of powder in the cabin, with many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
grains scattered over the floor; also flints and pieces
of iron strowed about. It was a very narrow escape
from an explosion which might have blown the Mayflower,
with all its occupants, into the air. This John
Billington, “a mischievous and troublesome fellow,”
was dissatisfied with the authority with which Captain
Standish was invested. He endeavored to undermine
his influence by assailing him with insulting and
opprobrious language. This was a very serious offense,
since, in their perilous position, it was a matter
of infinite moment that the orders of their military
commander should be implicitly obeyed. The whole
company was convened to try the culprit and pass
sentence upon him. “He was adjudged to have his
neck and heels tied together. But upon humbling
himself and craving pardon, and it being the first offense,
he was forgiven.”</p>

<p>Several days passed, and the Indians, who had
retired into the forest, did not return. The cottages
of the Pilgrims, each man building his own, had now
become habitable, and Monday and Tuesday, the
weather being fair, they were busy digging the ground
and sowing their garden seeds. On Wednesday morning,
the 21st of March, Samoset was sent into the
woods to ascertain why the Indians did not come back
according to their promise. He had but just disappeared
in the forest when two savages, in war costume
and thoroughly armed, appeared upon the hill,
on the other side of Town Brook—the same eminence
upon which the two Indians had appeared on the 17th
of February—and brandishing their weapons, with
every demonstration of hostility, seemed to bid the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
new-comers defiance. This was probably one of the
acts in their drama of incantation.</p>

<p>Captain Standish, who was ever prompt to assume
any office of danger, took a companion with him and
advanced to meet the challengers. They both took
their muskets, but carefully avoided any attitude of
menace. Two other Pilgrims followed, at a little distance,
also with their muskets, to render aid should
there be any rush of the Indians from an ambush.
But before Captain Standish had arrived within arrow-shot
of the natives they both turned, as before, and
fled.</p>

<p>In consequence of sickness and the imperfect accommodations
on the shore, several of the Pilgrim
company had thus far remained on board the Mayflower.
To-day, however, the shallop brought them
all to the land, and their colonizing became complete.
One-half of the crew of the ship had already died;
and so many of the remainder were enfeebled by sickness
that Captain Jones did not deem it safe to undertake
his return voyage in so crippled a condition.
A month passed before the sick and his diminished
crew were so far recovered as to allow him to venture
to set sail.</p>

<p>The sun of Thursday morning, with healing in its
beams, rose bright and warm over the busy little village
of the exiles. The dreary winter had manifestly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
passed. The sick were generally recovering, and
there was presented a very cheering scene of peace,
industry and happiness. At noon all the men had
met upon some public business, when, in the midst
of their deliberations, they saw Samoset returning, accompanied
by three other Indians. The name of one
was Squantum, and it was said that he was the only
surviving member of the Patuxat tribe, who had formerly
occupied the territory upon which the Pilgrims
had now settled.</p>

<p>His story, undoubtedly truthful, was that he was
one of the men whom Captain Hunt had so infamously
kidnapped. He had been carried to Spain and sold
there as a slave. A humane Englishman, whose name
we love to perpetuate, Mr. John Slaney, chanced to
meet the poor fugitive. He liberated him, took him
to England, and treated him with that truly fraternal
kindness which Christianity enjoins upon all men.
At length he had an opportunity to send Squantum
back to his native land.</p>

<p>Good deeds and bad deeds ever bear their corresponding
fruit. As the treachery of the miserable
Hunt caused the hostility of the Indians, the massacre
of the shipwrecked Frenchmen, and the attack at
the First Encounter, so did the brotherly kindness of
good John Slaney secure for the Pilgrims, in their
hour of need, a permanent and influential friend.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Squantum, forgetting the outrage of the knave who
had kidnapped him, remembered only the kindness
of his benefactor. His residence in England had
rendered him quite familiar with the English language,
and he became invaluable to the Pilgrims as an interpreter.
He attached himself cordially to them, and
taught them many things of great value in their new
life in the wilderness. And when, after many years,
he died, the good old man was heard praying that
God would take him to the heaven of the white men.</p>

<p>Squantum had joined the powerful tribe of the
Wampanoags, his own tribe having become extinct.
These Indians brought with them a few skins to sell,
and some dried red herrings; and they also announced
the rather startling intelligence that their
great Sagamore, or King Massasoit, accompanied by
his brother Quadequina and a retinue of sixty warriors,
was near at hand to pay the Pilgrims a friendly
visit.</p>

<p>After the lapse of an hour Massasoit appeared
on the top of Watson’s Hill with his plumed warriors.
From that eminence, distant about a quarter of a
mile, they had a perfect view of the little village, and
were conspicuously exposed to the view of the Pilgrims.
Under the circumstances, knowing not what
might be the treachery of the Indians, Captain Standish
did not deem it safe to allow so powerful a band<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
of armed savages to enter the village, or to allow any
considerable band of his weak force to withdraw from
behind the intrenchments which they had reared, and
to go out to meet the royal retinue. Neither did
Massasoit deem it prudent to place himself in the
power of the white men, whom the treachery of Hunt
had caused him to dread.</p>

<p>After several messages had passed to and fro
between the two parties, through Squantum, their interpreter,
Massasoit, who, though unlettered, proved
himself to be a man of much sagacity, proposed that
the Pilgrims should send one of their men to his encampment
to communicate to him their designs in
settling upon lands which had belonged to one of his
vassal tribes. Mr. Edward Winslow consented to go
upon this important and somewhat hazardous mission.
He took, as a present to the barbarian monarch,
two skins and a copper necklace, with a jewel
attached to it. He also took to Quadequina a knife,
an ear-ring, consisting of a pendent jewel, some biscuit
and butter, and, we are sorry to add, a jug of
rum; but those were the days of ignorance which
God winked at.</p>

<p>Mr. Winslow, accompanied by Squantum, as his
interpreter, crossed the brook, ascended Watson’s
Hill, and presented himself before the Indian chief.
“Our messenger,” writes Mourt, “made a speech<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
unto him, that King James saluted him with words
of love and peace, and did accept him as his friend
and ally; and that our Governor desired to see him,
and to truck with him, and to confirm a peace with
him, as his next neighbor.”</p>

<p>Massasoit listened attentively to the speech, as
communicated to him by the interpreter, and seemed
much pleased with it. In token of amity, they had a
little feast together. Massasoit seemed much impressed
with the long and glittering sword which
hung by the side of Mr. Winslow, and expressed a
strong desire to purchase it; but Mr. Winslow could
not consent to part with the weapon.</p>

<p>After a pleasant and very friendly interview, Massasoit,
cautiously leaving Mr. Winslow as a hostage
in the custody of his brother Quadequina, came down
to the brook with twenty men, as his retinue, all unarmed.
Six of them were sent into the village, as
hostages in exchange for Mr. Winslow.</p>

<p>Then Captain Standish, with one companion, probably
Mr. Thomas Williams, and followed by half a
dozen musketeers, advanced to the brook to meet the
royal guest and to escort him, with all due honor, to
the presence of their Governor. A salute of six muskets
was fired, and the monarch with his Indian band
was led to an unfinished house which had been hastily
decorated for their reception. It was deemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
important to arrange something of an imposing pageant
to impress the minds of their barbarian visitors.
Two or three cushions were laid down, covered with
a green carpet, as seats for the Indian chief and for
the Governor in this important interview. As soon
as Massasoit was seated the music of drums and of
a trumpet was heard, and Governor Carver, with a
suitable retinue, entered. Gracefully he took the
hand of Massasoit and kissed it. In accordance
with the mistaken views of hospitality in those days,
ardent spirits were brought forward to regale the
guests. This was probably the first time Massasoit
had ever seen the accursed liquid, and he was entirely
unacquainted with its fiery nature. The Indian
chieftain, deeming it a part of politeness to partake
generously of the entertainment provided for him,
when the goblet was presented, “drunk a great draft
which made him sweat all the while after.”</p>

<p>Massasoit was a remarkable man. He was of
majestic stature, in the prime of life, of grave and
stately demeanor, reserved in speech, and ever proving
faithful to all his obligations. He wore a chain
of white bone beads about his neck, and a little bag
of tobacco, from which he smoked himself and presented
to Governor Carver to smoke. His face was
painted of a deep red color, and his hair and face so
oiled as to present a very glossy appearance. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
followers were also all painted, in various styles and
of various colors. Some were partially clothed in
skins, others were nearly naked. They were all tall,
powerful men. After much friendly deliberation, the
Governor and Massasoit entered into the following
very simple, but comprehensive treaty of peace and
alliance:</p>

<p>1. The Sagamore pledged himself that none of his
men should do any harm to the Pilgrims; and that, if
any harm were done, the offender should be sent to
them that they might punish them.</p>

<p>2. That, if any property belonging to the white
men should be taken away, it should be restored,
Governor Carver agreeing to the same in reference
to his party.</p>

<p>3. The Governor agreed that if any Indian tribe
should wage an unjust war against Massasoit, he
would help him; Massasoit agreeing in the same way
to aid the Pilgrims, should they be assailed.</p>

<p>4. Massasoit pledged himself to send word to all
his confederate tribes that he had entered into this
alliance with the white men, and to enjoin its faithful
observance upon them.</p>

<p>5. Finally, it was agreed that whenever any of the
Indians visited the settlement of the white men, they
should leave their arms behind them. The Pilgrims
were also bound always to go unarmed whenever they
should visit the residence of the Indian chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
As evening approached, Massasoit and his followers
withdrew. The Governor accompanied him to
the brook, where they embraced and separated. The
six Indian hostages were retained until Mr. Winslow
should be returned. But soon word was brought that
Quadequina wished to make them a short visit. He
soon appeared, with quite a troop around him. He
was a young man, tall, modest and gentlemanly. He
was also conducted, with music of drum and fife, to
the Governor. He seemed very much afraid of the
muskets; and to calm his manifest fears they were
laid aside. After a short interview he returned to
the hill, and Mr. Winslow came back to the camp.
The Indian hostages were also then released. The
scenes of the day had inspired them with so much
confidence in the Pilgrims that two of them wished
to remain all night. But Captain Standish did not
deem it prudent to grant their request.</p>

<p>Samoset and Squantum remained with the Pilgrims.
Massasoit withdrew his party from the hill,
about half a mile south into the forest, and there they
encamped for the night. Their wives and children
were with them there. During the night both parties
kept up a vigilant watch, for neither had, as yet, full
confidence in the other. In the morning several of
the Indians came into the settlement, according to
their agreement, unarmed. They said that in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
days they should come to the other side of the brook
and plant corn, and remain there with their families
all summer. The king sent an invitation to have some
of the Pilgrims visit him.</p>

<p>“Captain Standish and Israel Alderton,” writes
Mourt, “went venturously, who were welcomed of
him after their manner. He gave them three or four
ground nuts and some tobacco. We cannot yet conceive
but that he is willing to have peace with us;
for they have seen our people sometimes alone, two
or three in the woods, at work and fowling, when
they offered them no harm, as they might easily have
done, and especially as he has a potent adversary in
the Narragansets, that are at war with him, against
whom he thinks we may be some strength to him, for
our pieces are terrible unto them.”</p>

<p>The English visitors remained in the encampment
of Massasoit until about eleven o’clock. Governor
Carver sent by them to the chief a kettleful of peas,
which the Indians seemed to regard as truly a princely
gift. The next day, Friday, it was again pleasant.
Squantum, who with Samoset, still remained with the
Pilgrims, went to a neighboring creek, since appropriately
called Eel River, and at night came home
with as many eels as he could carry. “They were
fat and sweet. He trod them out with his feet, and
so caught them with his hands, without any other instrument.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
In a comparatively recent history of Plymouth,
it is stated that a hundred and fifty barrels of
eels are annually taken from that creek. The Pilgrims
on that day held a general meeting, to conclude
some military arrangements, to enact certain needful
laws, and to choose a Governor for the year. The
choice fell, with apparently great unanimity, upon the
then incumbent, Mr. John Carver.</p>

<p>In Young’s Chronicle of the Pilgrims we find a
note containing the following statement: “It will be
recollected that Carver had been chosen Governor on
the 11th of November, the same day on which the
Compact was signed. It was now the 23d of March,
and the new year commencing on the 25th, according
to the calendar then in use, Carver was re-elected for
the ensuing year.”</p>

<p>Pleasant summer days now came, and glided rapidly
away, with nothing occurring of essential importance.
Friendly relations were established with the
Indians, and the affairs of the colony seemed as prosperous
as, under the circumstances, could be expected.
On the 5th of April the Mayflower weighed anchor
and set sail on her return voyage to England. She
had but one-half of the crew with which she had
sailed from Old Plymouth. The rest had fallen victims
to the winter’s sickness. It is remarkable that,
notwithstanding the hardships to which the Pilgrims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
were exposed, not one was disposed to abandon the
enterprise and return in the ship. When the Mayflower
left, there remained in the colony but fifty-five
persons. Of these, nineteen only were men. The
remaining thirty-six were women, children and servants.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the ship disappeared over the distant
horizon, ere Governor Carver, “oppressed by his great
care and pains for the common good,” on one hot
April noon returned from the field, complaining of a
severe pain in his head, probably caused by a sunstroke.
He soon became delirious, and, in a few days,
died. It was a severe loss to the colony, and they
mourned over him with great lamentation and heaviness.
He was buried with all the imposing ceremonies
of sorrow which the feeble colony could arrange. His
wife, overwhelmed with grief in view of her terrible
loss, in a few weeks followed her husband to the grave.
Soon after, Mr. William Bradford, who was then in a
state of great debility from his recent sickness, was
chosen his successor.</p>

<p>The settlers, having no animals to draw the plough,
were laboriously opening the ground near their dwellings
with the spade. Six acres they sowed with barley
and peas. Fortunately they had ten bushels of
corn for seed. With this they planted twenty acres,
Squantum showing them how to plant and hill it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Berries were found in abundance in the woods, as the
season advanced, and a very grateful supply of grapes.</p>

<p>Mr. Palfrey, in his admirable History of New England,
writes very pleasantly, “A visitor to Plymouth
during this summer, as he landed, on the southern
side of a high bluff, would have seen, standing between
it and a rapid little stream, a rude house of logs,
twenty feet square, containing the common property
of the plantation. Proceeding up a gentle declivity,
between two rows of log cabins, nineteen in number,
some of them, perhaps, vacant since the death of
their first tenants, he would have come to a hill surmounted
with a platform for cannon. He might have
counted twenty men at work with hoes, in the enclosures
about the huts, or fishing in the shallow harbor,
or visiting the woods or beach for game; while
six or eight women were busy in household affairs,
and some twenty children, from infancy upwards,
completed the domestic picture.”</p>

<p>All fears of famine seem now to have passed away.
In addition to the stores which they brought with them
they had an abundant supply of fish, wild fowls and
native fruits. On the 18th of June two of the servants
of Mr. Hopkins undertook to fight a duel with
sword and dagger. Both were wounded. The Pilgrims
met in a body to adjudge the penalty for so serious
an offense. They were sentenced to be tied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
together, by their head and feet, and thus to lie
twenty-four hours, without meat or drink. The punishment
was begun to be inflicted, “But within an
hour, because of their great pains, at their own and
their master’s humble request, upon promise of better
carriage, they are released by the Governor.”</p>

<p>Early in July, Governor Bradford decided to send
a deputation to visit Massasoit. There were several
objects he wished to accomplish by this mission.
First, it was desirable to ascertain where he lived and
what his strength was. He also wished to honor Massasoit
by paying him a friendly visit. Another consideration
of no little importance which influenced
him was, that vagabond Indians were increasingly in
the habit of coming with their wives and children,
loitering about the village to the great annoyance of
the settlers, and clamoring for food, which they devoured
with the voracity of famished wolves.</p>

<p>Mr. Winslow and Mr. Hopkins, accompanied by
Squantum as their interpreter, were appointed for this
important mission. Mr. Winslow has transmitted to
us a minute account of the interesting adventure.
They left the village, probably on Tuesday morning,
July 3d, bearing the following message to Massasoit,
with the present of a brilliant horseman’s coat, of red
cotton, gaudily laced.</p>

<p>“Inasmuch as your subjects come often and without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
fear, upon all occasions amongst us, so we are now
come unto you. In witness of the love and good will
the English bear you, our Governor has sent you a
coat, desiring that the peace and amity between us
may be continued; not that we fear you, but because
we intend not to injure any one, desiring to live peaceably,
as with all men, so especially with you our nearest
neighbors.</p>

<p>“But whereas your people come very often, and
very many together, unto us, bringing for the most
part their wives and children with them, they are welcome.
Yet we being but strangers, as yet, at Patuxet,
or New Plymouth, and not knowing how our corn
may prosper, can no longer give them such entertainment
as we have done, and as we desire still to do.
Yet if you will be pleased to come yourself, or any
special friend of yours desires to see us, coming from
you, they shall be welcome.</p>

<p>“And to the end that we may know them from
others, our Governor has sent you a copper chain,
desiring that if any messenger should come from you
to us, we may know him by his bringing it with him,
and may give credit to his message accordingly.”</p>

<p>They then added the following, which we record
with pleasure, as showing the conscientiousness of
these remarkable men:</p>

<p>“At our first arrival at Paomet, called by us Cape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Cod, we found there corn buried in the ground, and
finding no inhabitants, but some graves of the dead
newly buried, took the corn, resolving that if ever we
could hear of any that had right thereunto, to make
satisfaction to the full for it. Yet since we understand
the owners thereof had fled, for fear of us, our
desire is either to pay them with the like quantity of
corn, or with English meal, or any other commodities
we have, which they may desire. We request that
some of your men may signify so much unto them,
and we will content him for his pains.</p>

<p>“Last of all, our Governor requested one favor of
him, which was that he would exchange some of their
corn for seed, with us, that we might make trial which
was best agreed with the soil where we live.”</p>

<p>It was a warm and sunny day when the two Pilgrims,
with their Indian guide, set out on their adventurous
journey through the forest. The Indians,
in their movements from place to place, however numerous
the party, always went, with moccasined feet, in
single file, one following after the other. The forests
were threaded with many of these narrow paths, or
trails, which had thus been trodden by them through
countless generations. These paths were as well
known by them, and almost as distinctly marked, as
the paved roads of the Old World which had resounded
with the tramp of the Roman legions. Indian instinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
had, ages ago, selected these routes, often
through glooms which no rays of the sun ever penetrated,
and again through scenes of marvellous picturesque
beauty, beneath frowning mountains, along
the margin of crystal lakes, and upon the banks of
sparkling rivulets.</p>

<p>Much to the annoyance of the two Pilgrims appointed
upon this mission a party of ten or twelve
lazy Indians, men, women and children, uninvited,
persistently tagged after them, often very vexatiously
intrusive, and ever clamorous to share their food.</p>

<p>The first day they travelled about fifteen miles, to
an Indian village called Namasket. It was situated
upon a branch of what is now called the Taunton
River, within the limits of the present town of Middleborough.</p>

<p>“Thither we came,” writes Mr. Winslow, “about
three o’clock after noon; the inhabitants entertaining
us with joy, in the best manner they could, giving us
a kind of bread called by them <em>maizium</em>,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and the
spawn of shads, which they then got in abundance,
insomuch that they gave us spoons to eat them. With
these they boiled musty acorns; but of the shads we
ate heartily.”</p>

<p>These Indians had probably all heard of the wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
power of the muskets of the white men, though,
perhaps, none of them had ever seen the effects accomplished
by powder and ball. The crows troubled
their corn fields, and it was almost impossible for the
Indians to get near enough to these wary animals to
hit them with the arrow. They begged their guests
to show them the power of their guns by shooting
some of these crows. There was one upon a tree at
the distance of about two hundred and forty feet.
With intense interest the Indians watched as they
saw one of the Pilgrims take deliberate aim at the
bird, and when they heard the report, and saw the
bird fall dead, struck by an invisible shaft, their astonishment
passed all bounds. Several crows were thus
shot, exciting the admiration and awe of all the savage
beholders.</p>

<p>As Squantum told the Pilgrims that it was more
than a day’s journey from Namasket to Pokanoket, or
Mount Hope, where Massasoit resided, and that
there was a good place to pass the night about eight
miles further on their way, they decided to resume
their journey. About sunset they reached a small
group of Indians at a place now called Titicut, on
Taunton River, in the northwest part of Middleborough,
adjoining Bridgewater.</p>

<p>Here quite an attractive region presented itself to
their eyes. The land on both sides of the river had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
long been cleared, being entirely free from trees or
stumps, and had evidently waved with cornfields.
There were many indications that the place had formerly
been quite thickly inhabited. The plague, of
which we have spoken, it is said, had swept every individual
into the grave. A few wandering outcast
Indians had come to this depopulated region to take
fish. By means of a wear in the river, which consisted
of a sort of net or fence, constructed of
branches of trees and twigs, they caught an abundance
of bass. They had not erected any shelter for
themselves, but were sleeping, like the cattle, in the
open air. These wretched savages had no food but
fish and roasted acorns. Very greedily they partook
of the stores which the Pilgrims brought with them.
Liberally they were fed, “we not doubting,” writes
Mr. Winslow, “but that we should have enough where’er
we came.”</p>

<p>The Pilgrims lodged that night in the open fields.
The next morning, at an early hour, after such frugal
breakfast as the occasion could furnish, they set out
again upon their journey. Six savages followed them.
Having travelled about six miles, following down the
banks of the river, they came to a shoal place, where
the stream could be forded. This was undoubtedly
at a spot now called Squabetty, three and a half miles
from Taunton Green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
“Here,” writes Mr. Winslow, “let me not forget
the valor and courage of some of the savages on the
opposite side of the river; for there were remaining
alive only two men, both aged, especially the one being
about threescore. These two, espying a company
of men entering the river, ran very swiftly, and
low in the grass, to meet us at the bank, where, with
shrill voices and great courage, standing, they charged
upon us with their bows, demanding who we were,
supposing us to be enemies, and thinking to take advantage
of us in the water. But seeing we were
friends, they welcomed us with such food as they had,
and we bestowed a small bracelet of beads upon them.”</p>

<p>Here, after refreshing themselves, they continued
their journey down the western banks of the river.
It was a very sultry July day, but the country was
beautiful, and abundantly watered with innumerable
small streams, and cool, bubbling springs. The savages
would never drink of the flowing brooks, but
only at the spring heads. Very pleasantly Mr. Winslow
writes in reference to the amiability and obliging
disposition of these savages:</p>

<p>“When we came to any brook where no bridge
was, two of them desired to carry us through, of their
own accord. Also, fearing that we were or would be
weary, they offered to carry our pieces. If we would
lay off any of our clothes, we should have them carried.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
And as the one of them had found more special
kindness from one of the messengers, and the other
savage from the other, so they showed their thankfulness
accordingly, in affording us all help and furtherance
in the journey.”</p>

<p>It was very manifest to the travellers, as we have
said, that they were passing through a country which
once had been crowded with a population which but
recently had been swept away. There were widely
extended fields, which had formerly been planted with
corn, where there was then to be seen but a rank
growth of weeds, higher than a man’s head. The region
was pleasantly diversified with hills and plains,
often presenting extended forests of the most valuable
timber. It was a very noticeable and beautiful feature
in these forests, that they were entirely free of underbrush,
presenting the aspect of the most carefully-trimmed
English park. Mr. Wood, who visited this
region in year 1633, writes:</p>

<p>“Whereas it is generally conceived that the woods
grow so thick that there is no more clear ground than
is hewed out by labor of men, it is nothing so; in many
places divers acres being clear, so that one may ride
a hunting in most places of the land. There is no
underwood, saving in swamps and low grounds; for,
it being the custom of the Indians to burn the woods
in November, when the grass is withered and leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
dried, consumes all the underwood and rubbish, which
otherwise would overgrow the country, making it impassable,
and spoil their much-affected hunting. So
that in these places there is scarce a bush or bramble
or any cumbersome underwood to be seen in the
more champaign ground.”</p>

<p>Hour after hour they journeyed on through these
lonely fields, without meeting an individual. At
length one solitary Indian was espied in the distance.
The Indians, who accompanied the Pilgrims, seemed
much alarmed, from fear that he might be one of the
Narraganset tribe, with whom Massasoit was then at
war, and that there might be more of the Narragansets
near at hand. The Pilgrims, however, bade
them not to fear, assuring them that, with their guns,
they should not hesitate to meet twenty of the foe.
The savage was hailed. He proved to be a friend,
having two women with him. The two parties interchanged
courtesies, ate and drank together, and separated,
well pleased with each other.</p>

<p>Soon after this they met another Indian, also accompanied
by two women. They had been at a rendezvous,
by a salt water creek, and had some baskets
full of roasted crabs and other small shell-fish. They,
also, in oriental fashion, ate and drank together, in
token of friendship. The women were made very
happy by a present each of a string of beads, as brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
in their eyes as the priceless jewels of the crown
to any European queen. “There is but one step
between the sublime and the ridiculous.” The
step is equally short between the court-dress of
an European monarch and his jeweled queen, and
that of the feathered Indian warrior and his beaded
squaw.</p>

<p>Continuing their journey, they soon reached one
of the small towns of Massasoit. This was probably
Mattapoiset, now known as Gardner’s Neck, in Swansey.
They were hospitably received here, and fed
with oysters and other fish.</p>

<p>The latter part of the afternoon they reached Pokanoket,
on the northern shore of Narraganset Bay.
The capital of the Indian monarch, which they had
thus entered, was about forty miles from Plymouth.
The spot where the little cluster of wigwams stood,
was probably Sowams, in the present town of Warren.
We cannot better describe the interview which took
place, than in the language of Mr. Winslow:</p>

<p>“Massasoit was not at home. There we stayed,
he being sent for. When news was brought of his
coming, our guide, Squantum, requested that, at our
meeting, we would discharge our pieces. But one of
us going about to discharge his piece, the women and
children, through fear to see him take up his piece,
ran away, and could not be pacified till he laid it down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
again; who afterwards were better informed by our
interpreter.</p>

<p>“Massasoit being come, we discharged our pieces
and saluted him; who, after their manner, kindly
welcomed us, and took us into his house and set us
down by him; where, having delivered our foresaid
message and presents, and having put the coat on his
back, and the chain about his neck, he was not a little
proud to behold himself, as were his men also, to
see their king so bravely attired.</p>

<p>“In answer to our message, he told us we were
welcome, and he would gladly continue that peace
and friendship which was between him and us. As
for his men, they should no longer pester us as they
had done. He would also send us corn for seed, according
to our request.</p>

<p>“This being done, his men gathered near to him,
to whom he turned himself and made a great speech;
they sometimes interposing, and, as it were, confirming
and applauding him in that he said.”</p>

<p>In this harangue the king enumerated thirty
towns or villages over which his sovereignty was recognized;
and enjoined it upon his people ever to live
in peace with the white men, and to carry to them furs
for sale.</p>

<p>“This being ended he lighted tobacco for us, and
fell to discoursing of England and of the King’s Majesty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
marvelling that he would live without a wife.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
Also he talked of the Frenchmen, bidding us not to
suffer them to come to Narraganset, for it was King
James’s country, and he was King James’s man.
Late it grew, but victuals he offered us none; for, indeed,
he had not any, he being so newly come home.
So we desired to go to rest. He laid us on the bed
with himself and his wife, they at the one end and
we at the other, it being only planks laid a foot from
the ground, and a thin mat upon them. Two more
of his chief men, for want of room, pressed by and
upon us, so that we were worse weary of our lodging
than of our journey.</p>

<p>“The next day being Thursday, many of their
<em>sachems</em>, or petty governors, came to see us, and many
of their men also. There they went to their manner
of games for skins and knives. We challenged them
to shoot with us for skins, but they durst not; only
they desired one of us to shoot at a mark, who, shooting
with hail-shot, they wondered to see the mark so
full of holes.</p>

<p>“About one o’clock Massasoit brought two fishes
that he had shot. They were like bream, but three
times as big, and better meat.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> These, being boiled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
there were at least forty looked for share in them.
The most ate of them. This meal only we had in
two nights and a day. And had not one of us bought
a partridge we had taken our journey fasting.</p>

<p>“Very importunate he was to have us stay with
him longer. But we desired to keep the Sabbath at
home, and feared that we should either be lightheaded
for want of sleep, for what with bad lodging,
the savage’s barbarious singing, for they use to sing
themselves asleep, lice and fleas within doors, and
mosquitoes without, we could hardly sleep all of the
time of our being there; we much fearing that if we
should stay any longer we should not be able to recover
home for want of strength. So that on Friday
morning, before sun-rising, we took our leave and departed,
Massasoit being both grieved and ashamed
that he could no better entertain us.”</p>

<p>Their journey home was a weary one. They commenced
it hungry, and without any supply of food for
the way. Squantum and five other Indians accompanied
them, who were accustomed to the hardships
of the wilderness, and knew how to obtain food if there
were roots or berries, game or fish anywhere within
reach. When they arrived at Mattapoiset, the friendly
but half-starved Indians there refreshed them with a
small fish, a handful of parched corn, and a few clams.
The clams they gave to their six Indians, reserving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
for themselves only the little fish and the handful of
meal, which by no means satiated their craving appetites.
The Indians led them five miles out of their
way, with the hope of obtaining food, but they found
the place abandoned and no food there.</p>

<p>Hungry and weary they toiled along, and that
night reached the wear at Titicut, on Taunton River.
Here again they found famine. But one of the hospitable
savages, who had speared a shad, and shot a
small squirrel, gave half to the nearly famished travellers.
In this starving condition they sent one of
the Indians forward to Plymouth, imploring their
brethren immediately to send an Indian runner to
meet them at Namasket with food. Fortunately that
evening a large number of fishes were caught in the
wear, so that they feasted abundantly upon roasted
fish, and their fatigue enabled them to sleep soundly
in the open air. In the morning, after another ample
breakfast of roasted fish, which their good appetites
rendered palatable, they set out again upon their
journey.</p>

<p>About two o’clock in the morning it had commenced
raining with great violence, accompanied with
thunder and lightning. The fire which the Pilgrims
had built to keep their feet warm was extinguished,
and, drenched with the rain and shivering with cold,
they must have suffered severely had not their great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
fatigue rendered them almost insensible to the exposure.
The storm of wind and rain raged unabated
through the day. But they toiled on, wet and weary,
until, a little after noon, they reached Namasket.
Here they found the provisions which their companions
had sent them from Plymouth. Liberally they
rewarded all who had shown them any kindness by
the way. At night they reached home, wet, weary
and footsore. They had been absent five days, leaving
Plymouth Tuesday morning, and returning home
Saturday evening, having spent Thursday with the
renowned Indian monarch Massasoit.</p>

<p>We have before spoken of the notorious John Billington
and his ungovernable family. His boy John,
the same one who came so near causing the Mayflower
to be blown up with gunpowder, got lost in the
woods. The search to find him was unavailing. At
last news came that he had, after wandering five days
in the woods, living upon berries, been picked up by
the Nauset Indians, the same who had attacked the
Pilgrims at the First Encounter. Following an Indian
trail he had reached a small Indian village, called
Manomet, in the present town of Sandwich, about
twenty miles south of Plymouth. The Indians treated
him kindly, and took him with them still further down
the Cape to Nauset, in the present town of Barnstable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
Massasoit sent word to Governor Carver where he
was, and an expedition of ten men was immediately
fitted out, in the shallop, to bring him back. It was
a beautiful day, the latter part of July, when the boat
sailed from Plymouth harbor on this short trip. They
had not, however, been many hours at sea ere a tempest
arose with vivid lightning and heavy peals of
thunder. They ran, for shelter, into a place called
Cummaquit, which was doubtless Barnstable harbor.
Squantum and another Indian, by the name of Tokamahamon,
accompanied them, as interpreters and
aids.</p>

<p>It was night before they reached the harbor and
cast anchor. The receding tide left them dry upon
the flats. In the morning they saw several savages,
on the shore, seeking for shell-fish. The two Indian
interpreters were sent to communicate with them.
They returned stating that the boy was well, but that
he was several miles further down the Cape, at Nauset.
The Indians also invited the white men to come
on shore and eat with them. As soon as the returning
tide floated the boat they drew near to the shore,
and, cautiously taking four unarmed Indians on board
as hostages, six of the voyagers landed. Here they
had a very pleasant interview with the sachem, or
chief of the tribe, a young man, by the name of Tyanough,
but twenty-six years of age. He was very hospitable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
and seemed to have but little of the savage in
his nature. They describe him as “very personable,
gentle, courteous and fair conditioned.”</p>

<p>They met here with an aged Indian woman whom
they judged to be not less than one hundred years
old. She had never before seen a white man. As
soon as she saw the English she burst into a convulsive
fit of weeping. It appeared that she had three
sons who had been lured on board the ship of the infamous
Captain Hunt and kidnapped. They were
carried off to Spain, and she had never heard any tidings
from them. The Pilgrims spoke all the words
of comfort to the poor bereaved mother which they
could, assuring her that Captain Hunt was a very
wicked man, whom God would punish; that all the
English condemned him for his crime, and that they
would not be guilty of the like wickedness for all the
skins the country could afford. They made her some
presents which quite cheered her.</p>

<p>After dinner they re-embarked, on such friendly
terms with the natives that the chief and two of his
men went on board with them to accompany them on
the way. It was in the evening twilight when they
reached Nauset, and the tide was out. The savages
here seemed to be very numerous, and they crowded
the shore. It is supposed that the point which they
had reached here was in the present town of Eastham.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
The shallop touched the flats at quite a distance
from the land. Tyanough, the chief of the
Cummaquit Indians, and his two men, waded over
the wet and sandy flats to the beach. Squantum accompanied
them, to inform Aspinet, the chief of the
Nauset Indians, of their object in coming. The savages
manifested great eagerness of cordiality, flocked
out to the boat, and expressed more than willingness
to drag it over the flats to the shore. But the Pilgrims
would not allow this. They had not full confidence
in their sincerity. This was the same tribe
which had so fiercely assailed them in the First Encounter.</p>

<p>They, therefore, warned the Indians off, and with
their weapons stood guard, allowing but two to enter
the boat. One of these was from Manamoick, now
Chatham, and was one of the owners of the corn which
the Pilgrims had taken. The Pilgrims received him
with great kindness, and assured him that if he would
come to Plymouth they would repay him abundantly,
either in corn or other articles; or, if preferred, they
would send the payment to the Indians. He promised
to come to Plymouth.</p>

<p>Just after sunset Aspinet appeared upon the shore,
leading the boy, and accompanied by a train of nearly
one hundred men. Fifty of these, unarmed, came
wading through the water to the side of the shallop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
bringing the boy with them. The other fifty remained
at a little distance, armed with bows and arrows,
ready to meet any hostile demonstration. In token
of peace, and of his desire to cherish friendly relations
with the English, Aspinet had decorated the boy with
Indian ornaments. The Pilgrims here received also
the rather alarming intelligence that Massasoit had
been defeated in a battle with the Narragansets.
Seven men only had been left for the protection of
the colony. It was feared that the hostile Narragansets
might make an attack upon them. It therefore
appears that as soon as the tide came in, that very
night, they spread their sails for home. They made
Aspinet the present of a knife, and also gave a knife
to the Indian who first found the boy and protected
him.</p>

<p>The route which they had followed along the shore
was so circuitous that they estimated that they had
reached a point eighty miles from Plymouth. The
wind was contrary and their progress was slow. When
they reached Cummaquit they put in ashore for water.
Here they found Tyanough, who, having returned by
land, had reached the place before them. The obliging
chief took their water cask upon his own shoulders
and led them a long distance through the dark to a
spring of not very sweet water. The shallop was
anchored near the shore. The Indian women, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
manifestation of their good will, sang and danced upon
the beach, clasping hands.</p>

<p>Again they set sail, still encountering contrary
winds, but at length they reached their home in safety.
Soon after their return, they learned that the defeat
of Massasoit was more disastrous than had at first
been reported. It seems that a portion of the Indians
were much opposed to any friendly relations with the
white men, and wished for the extermination of the
colony. An Indian by the name of Hobbomak, who
was chief of one of the minor tribes, had now strongly
allied himself to the English. Consequently he and
Squantum were peculiarly obnoxious to those of the
savages who remained unfriendly.</p>

<p>One of Massasoit’s petty chieftains, named Corbitant,
led the hostile party. He was an audacious, insolent
fellow, residing in the present town of Middleborough,
at a point on the Namasket River just above
the bridge, which passes from the Green to the Four
Corners, on the Plymouth road. This man endeavored
to excite a revolt against Massasoit, assailing the Pilgrims
with the most opprobrious language, and storming
at the peace which had been made with them by
Massasoit and the tribes on the Cape. It seemed
also that he was entering into an alliance with the
Narraganset Indians against Massasoit and the Pilgrims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Hobbomak was a war captain among the Wampanoags,
and was greatly beloved by Massasoit. With
Squantum he set out on a journey to visit Massasoit,
with inquiries and words of cheer from the Pilgrims.
They were intercepted on their way by Corbitant,
and both captured. Hobbomak, being a very powerful
man, broke away and escaped. The next day,
breathless and terrified, he reached Plymouth, reporting
what had happened. On their journey they had
entered a wigwam at Namasket, when suddenly the
hut was surrounded by a band of armed savages.
Corbitant himself, brandishing a knife, approached
Squantum to kill him, saying, “When Squantum is
dead the English will have lost their tongue.” Just
then Hobbomak escaped, and, outrunning his pursuers,
reached Plymouth, not knowing the fate of his
companion.</p>

<p>These were sad tidings, indicating that a very
perilous storm was gathering. Governor Bradford
immediately assembled all the men of the colony to
decide what was to be done. After earnest prayer
and deliberation, they were united in the opinion that,
should they suffer their friends and allies to be thus
assailed with impunity, none of the Indians, however
kindly disposed, would dare to enter into friendly relations
with them. They therefore resolved to send
ten men, one-half of their whole number, under Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Standish, with Hobbomak as their guide, to seize
Corbitant and avenge the outrage. Never did a
heroic little band set out upon a more chivalric adventure.</p>

<p>The morning of the 14th of August was dark and
stormy. Regardless of wind and rain Captain Standish
led his valiant companions in single file through
the narrow and dripping paths of the forest. It was
late in the afternoon when they reached a secluded
spot within four miles of Namasket. Here they concealed
themselves that they might suddenly fall upon
their foe in the darkness of night. Cautiously Captain
Standish, who was alike prudent and intrepid,
led his band. Every man received minute instructions
as to the part he was to perform. The night
was so dark, with clouds and driving rain, that they
could hardly see a hand’s breadth before them. They
lost their way, and after groping for some time in the
tangled thickets, happily again found their trail. It
was after midnight when, wet and weary, they arrived
within sight of the glimmering fires of Namasket.
After silently refreshing themselves from their knapsacks
they crept along to the large wigwam, where
they supposed that Corbitant, surrounded by several
of his warriors, was sleeping. The darkness of the
night and the wailings of the storm caused even the
wary Indians to be deaf to their approach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
“At a signal, two muskets were fired to terrify
the savages, and Captain Standish, with three or four
men, rushed into the hut. The ground floor, dimly
lighted by some dying embers, was covered with
sleeping Indians, men, women, and children. A
scene of indescribable consternation and confusion
ensued. Through Hobbomak, Captain Standish ordered
every Indian to remain in the wigwam, assuring
them that he had come for Corbitant, the murderer
of Squantum, and that, if he were not there, no one
else should be injured.</p>

<p>“But the savages, terrified by the midnight surprise,
and by the report of the muskets, were bereft
of reason. Many of them endeavored to escape, and
were severely wounded by the Pilgrims in their attempts
to stop them. The Indian boys, seeing that
the Indian women were not molested, ran around,
frantically exclaiming, ‘I am a girl! I am a girl!’</p>

<p>“At last order was restored, and it was found that
Corbitant was not there, but that he had gone off,
with all his train, and that Squantum was not killed.
A bright fire was now kindled, that the hut might be
carefully searched. Its blaze illuminated one of the
wildest of imaginable scenes. The wigwam, spacious
and rudely constructed of boughs, mats and bark;
the affrighted savages, men, women and children, in
their picturesque dress and undress, a few with ghastly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
wounds, faint and bleeding; the bold colonists, in
their European dress and armor; the fire blazing in
the centre of the hut, all combined to present a scene
such as few eyes have ever witnessed.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>By this time all the inmates of the adjoining wigwams
were aroused. Hobbomak, in the darkness,
climbed to the top of the wigwam and shouted aloud
for Squantum. In his response to his well-known
voice, Squantum soon appeared. Captain Standish
deprived all the Indian warriors of their bows and arrows,
and having established a watch, sought such
repose as they could find until morning.</p>

<p>Many of these Indians were friendly to the English,
and they, with the earliest light of the morning,
gathered around Captain Standish. The hostile Indians,
who belonged to the faction of Corbitant, fled
during the night. It seemed, however, that a majority
were disposed to be friendly, for a large group
gathered around Captain Standish, with pledges of
their good will. He addressed them in words of conciliation,
and yet of firmness, assuring them that,
though Corbitant had for the present escaped, if he
continued his hostility he could find no retreat from
the avenging hand of the white man. He also assured
them that if the Narragansets continued their assaults<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
upon Massasoit or upon any of his subjects,
the white men would punish them by the utter overthrow
of their tribe. He expressed much regret that
any of the Indians had been wounded, but told them
that it was their own fault, as he had assured them
that they should not be harmed if they would remain
in the hut. He also offered to take home with him
any who were wounded, that they might be carefully
nursed. Two of the wounded availed themselves of
this offer. The surgeon of the Pilgrim company, Mr.
Samuel Fuller, tenderly cared for them.</p>

<p>Captain Standish led his triumphant little band
back, accompanied by Squantum, and many other
friendly Indians. The heroic achievement taught the
friendly Indians that they could rely upon the protection
of the white men, and was a loud warning to
those who were disposed to be hostile. The enterprise
occupied but two days. As the result of this
adventure, many Sachems sent in the expression of
their desire to enter into a friendly alliance with the
Pilgrims. Corbitant himself was frightened by such
an exhibition of energy, and by his own narrow escape.
He sought reconciliation through the intercession
of Massasoit, and subsequently signed a treaty
of submission and friendship. Even Canonicus, the
hostile and warlike chief of the Narragansets, sent
an embassy to Plymouth, not improbably as spies, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
with the professed object of treating for peace. The
friendship of Massasoit, and his influence over the
chiefs of the smaller tribes, contributed much to this
happy result.</p>

<p>The Blue Hills of Milton were then called Mount
Massachusetts. Many rumors had reached the colonists
that the tribes residing in that vicinity, about
forty miles north from Plymouth, were very unfriendly,
had uttered many threats, and were preparing for
hostile measures. The Pilgrims decided to send an
expedition to that region, to establish, if possible,
friendly relations with the natives, and they also
wished to examine the country.</p>

<p>Captain Miles Standish was, of course, the one to
be entrusted with the command of the important enterprise.
He took a party in the shallop, of nine of
the colonists, and three Indians, as interpreters, one
of whom was Squantum. They set sail at midnight,
in consequence of the favoring tide. It was Tuesday
morning, the 18th of September, O. S. A gentle
southerly breeze pressed their sails, and they glided
over a smooth sea until they reached a point which
they estimated to be about sixty miles from the port
which they had left. As they had been informed that
the tribes were numerous and warlike, as well as unfriendly,
and it was a mild autumnal night, Captain
Standish did not deem it prudent to land, but they all
remained until morning in the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
They had entered a bay, which was doubtless
Boston harbor, and anchored but a short distance
from a cliff, which some have supposed to have been
Copp’s Hill, at the north end of Boston. This cliff
rose about fifty feet from the water, and presented a
precipitous front on the seaward shore.</p>

<p>The next morning they put in for the shore and
landed.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Here they found quite a quantity of lobsters
which the savages had collected, but for some
unknown reason had left. Captain Standish, with
characteristic prudence, left three men to guard the
shallop, and stationed two as sentinels, in a commanding
position on the shore, to give warning of any
appearance of danger. Then, with characteristic enterprise
and courage, taking four men with him, and
an Indian as guide and interpreter, he entered one of
the well-trodden trails of the forest and pressed forward
in search of the habitations of the Indians. It
was a bold deed; for, though they had guns, a hundred
Indian warriors, shooting their barbed arrows
from behind trees, would soon lay them all weltering
in blood.</p>

<p>They had not gone far before they met an Indian
woman who, it seems, owned some of the lobsters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
and was going to the shore to get them. But the
colonists had feasted upon the savory food. They
paid the woman, however, abundantly, to her entire
satisfaction. She informed them that the small tribe
to which she belonged, and whose chieftain’s name
was Obbatinewat, resided in a village a little farther
along the coast. They therefore sent Squantum
forward to the Indian village to inform Obbatinewat
that the Pilgrims were coming to make him a friendly
visit. Captain Standish returned to the shallop to
continue their voyage to the settlement.</p>

<p>It required but a short sail. The Indian chief
and his people, being prepared for their coming, received
them kindly. It is a remarkable fact that the
chief of the Massachusett tribe, probably the most
powerful tribe then in these borders, was a woman—a
squaw. Upon the death of her husband, Nanepashemet,
she had been recognized as his successor.
She was known as the Squaw Sachem, and was at
war with Obbatinewat. Captain Standish offered his
services to promote reconciliation. This was certainly
magnanimous, for according to the principles
of selfish worldly policy, it would have seemed expedient
to keep the tribes warring against each other,
thus to prevent their combining against the Pilgrims,
and thus enabling the Pilgrims to retain what is called
the balance of power. But Miles Standish, a straightforward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
honest man, scorned all such arts of expediency.</p>

<p>Obbatinewat resided near the bottom of the inner
Massachusetts Bay. He was ever trembling in view
of the incursions of a powerful tribe of Indians, who
resided on the Kennebec, the Penobscot, and other
rivers of Maine. They came in great numbers in time
of harvest, robbing them of their corn and committing
all manner of savage outrages.</p>

<p>Very gladly Obbatinewat, who seems to have been
an amiable, peace-loving man, availed himself of the
friendly offer of Captain Standish, and, with some of
his people, accompanied him in the shallop across the
harbor, it is supposed from Quincy to what is now
Charlestown, to visit the squaw sachem. Mr. Winslow
describes the visit in the following words:</p>

<p>“Again we crossed the bay, which is very large,
and hath at least fifty islands in it; but the certain
number is not known to the inhabitants. Night it
was before we came to that side of the bay where this
people were. On shore the savages went, but found
nobody. That night also we rode at anchor aboard
the shallop.</p>

<p>“On the morrow we went ashore, all but two men,
and marched, in arms, up in the country. Having
gone three miles we came to a place where corn had
been newly gathered, a house pulled down, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
people gone. A mile from hence Nanepashemet,
their king, in his lifetime, had lived. His house was
not like others: but a scaffold was largely built with
poles and planks, some six feet from the ground, and
the house upon that, being situated on the top of a
hill.</p>

<p>“Not far from here, in a bottom, we came to a
fort, built by their deceased king; the manner thus:
There were poles, some thirty or forty feet long, stuck
in the ground as thick as they could be set one by
another. With these they enclosed a ring, some
thirty or forty feet long. A trench, breast-high, was
digged on each side. One way there was to go into
it with a bridge. In the midst of this palisade stood
the frame of a house, wherein, being dead, he lay
buried.</p>

<p>“About a mile from here we came to such another,
but seated on the top of a hill. Here Nanepashemet
was killed; none dwelling in it since the time of his
death. At this place we staid, and sent for two savages
to look for the inhabitants, and to inform them
of our ends in coming, that they might not be fearful
of us. Within a mile of this place they found the
women of the place together, with their corn on heaps,
whither we supposed them to have fled for fear of us;
and the more, because in divers places they had newly
pulled down their houses, and for haste, in one place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
had left some of their corn, covered with a mat, and
nobody with it.</p>

<p>“With much fear they entertained us, at first;
but seeing our gentle carriage towards them, they
took heart, and entertained us in the best manner
they could, boiling cod and such other things as they
had for us. At length, with much sending for, came
one of their men, shaking and trembling for fear.
But when he saw we intended them no hurt, but came
to truck, he promised us his skins also. Of him we
inquired for their queen. It seemed that she was far
from thence. At least we could not see her.</p>

<p>“Here Squantum would have had us rifle the savage
women, and take their skins and all such things
as might be serviceable for us; for, said he, they are
a bad people, and have often threatened you. But
our answer was, ‘Were they never so bad, we would
not wrong them, or give them any just occasion
against us. For their words we little weighed them;
but if they once attempted any thing against us, then
we would deal far worse than he desired.”</p>

<p>Having passed the day thus pleasantly, they returned
to the shallop. Nearly all the women accompanied
them. The Indians had quite a quantity of
beaver skins, from which very comfortable garments
were made. The Pilgrims were eager to purchase
these skins, and the Indian women were so eager to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
obtain, in exchange for them, such articles as the
English had to dispose of, that we are told “they sold
their coats from their backs, and tied boughs about
them, but with great shamefacedness, for indeed
they are more modest than some of our English
women are.”</p>

<p>The savages reported that there were two rivers
emptying into the bay, the Mystic and the Charles.
The Pilgrims, however, saw but one, and they had not
time to explore even that. They saw evidences that
most of the islands in the harbor had been inhabited,
having been cleared, and prepared for corn from end
to end. But they were now desolate, the plague having
swept the whole of their populations into the
grave. The food of the exploring party becoming
scarce, and there being a bright moon and a fair wind,
they set sail in the evening, and by noon of the next
day, Saturday, September 22d, they reached home,
having been absent four days. Mr. Winslow was one
of the party, and it is supposed that he wrote the account
from which we have quoted.</p>

<p>The adventurers brought back so glowing a report
of the harbor, with its beautiful and fertile islands,
the rivers and the rich soil, that the colonists quite
regretted that they had not found that spot for their
settlement. “The country of the Massachusetts,”
said they, “is the paradise of all those parts, for here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
are many isles, all planted with corn, groves, mulberries
and savage gardens.”</p>

<p>The summer had passed away with the Pilgrims
very pleasantly and prosperously. Friendly relations
had been established with the Indians, and a lucrative
traffic opened in valuable furs. There had been no
want of provisions. Fishing had been successful,
furnishing them with an abundant supply of cod and
bass. Water fowl, such as ducks and wild geese,
abounded, and the forests were filled with deer and
turkeys. In the autumn they gathered in a fine harvest
of corn, and though they had no mills to grind
it, by hand-pounding they converted it into meal, with
which they made very palatable cakes. Thus amply
supplied with food, they made their houses more tight
and comfortable, and gathered their fuel for the winter
fires. They wrote home such glowing letters of
their prosperity, that very many others were inspired
with the desire to join them. One of these letters,
written by Edward Winslow, will be given in the next
chapter.</p>

<p>Early in July of this year, 1621, the Fortune, a
small vessel of but fifty-five tons, which they called a
ship, sailed from London for the colony. There were
thirty-five passengers on board, many of whom appear
to have been mere adventurers, emigrating to the
New World through restlessness, curiosity, or love
of gain. The men of this party outnumbered the devout
Pilgrims who were still living at Plymouth. Thus
an influence was introduced to the colony quite adverse
to the religious element which had hitherto
pervaded it. In Mr. Robert Cushman’s “Relation of
the Reasons for Emigrating from England to America,”
he writes:</p>

<p>“And first, seeing we daily pray for the conversion
of the heathen, we must consider whether there
be not some ordinary means and course for us to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
to convert them; or whether prayer for them be only
referred to God’s extraordinary work from Heaven.
Now it seemeth unto me that we ought also to endeavor
and use the means to convert them. And the
means cannot be used unless we go to them or they
come to us. To us they cannot come. Our land is
full. To them we may go. Their land is empty.
This then is sufficient reason to prove our going
thither to live, lawful.”</p>

<p>The reckless men on board the Fortune, supposing
that they should find an ample supply of everything
in the New World, took with them scarcely
provisions enough to last during the voyage. Contrary
winds so retarded their progress that they did
not clear the English channel until the end of August.
It was not until the 9th of November that, in almost
a famishing condition, they cast anchor in the harbor
at the extremity of Cape Cod. Mr. Cushman, who
had been left behind by the abandonment of the
Speedwell, was with this party. The Fortune entered
Plymouth harbor on the 23d of November. The
Pilgrims were, of course, very happy to welcome such
a re-enforcement from home. They were not then
aware of the uncongenial elements of which it was
composed. Mr. Bradford, in his account of this event,
writes:</p>

<p>“Most of them were lusty young men, and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
of them wild enough, who little considered whither or
about what they went, till they came into the harbor
at Cape Cod, and there saw nothing but a naked and
barren place.</p>

<p>“They then began to think what would become
of them if the people here were dead, or cut off by
the Indians. They then began to consult upon some
speeches that some of the seamen had cast out, to
take the sails from the yards lest the ship should get
away and leave them there. But the master, hearing
of it, gave them good words, and told them that if
anything but well should have befallen the people
here, he hoped he had victuals enough to carry them
to Virginia; and that while he had a bit they should
have their parts; which gave them good satisfaction.”</p>

<p>These men were landed at Plymouth in a state of
great destitution. Of the thirty-five thus added to
the colony twenty-seven were men. The remainder
were women and children. Some of these men constituted
a valuable addition to the colony; but others
of them were utterly worthless. They brought with
them no food, no furniture, no domestic utensils, no
extra clothing; and, worst of all, no habits of industry
or established principles of industry.</p>

<p>The Fortune remained at Plymouth but about a
fortnight, and on the 13th of December commenced
her return voyage. She took back, as freight, various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
kinds of timber, sassafras, and beaver skins. The
estimated value of her cargo was about two thousand
five hundred dollars. We may mention, in passing,
that England was then at war with France. The Fortune,
when near the coast of England, was captured
by a French cruiser, relieved of her cargo, and sent
home.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that there were but seven
families composing the colony at the time of the arrival
of the Fortune. The Governor disposed of these
destitute and half famished new-comers, in these families,
as best he could. The Pilgrims had, before this
arrival, an ample supply of food for the winter. But
upon this unexpected doubling of their number of
hungry mouths, it was found, upon careful examination,
that their food was quite inadequate to meet their
wants until another harvest. The fishing season was
over; the summer game was gone; the harvest was
all gathered in. There could be no more addition to
their supply of provisions for many months. There
could be nothing obtained from the Indians. The
thoughtless creatures would themselves be hungry
before another summer should come. Under these
circumstances the Pilgrims, quite to their dismay,
found it necessary to put the colony upon half allowance
of food.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of the Fortune they were rejoicing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
in abundance. Now they found themselves upon
the verge of famine. Mr. Edward Winslow wrote a
letter to Mr. George Morton, probably the “G. Mourt,”
author of the celebrated “Relation.” This letter was
sent to England by the Fortune, on her return voyage,
and was dated the 21st of December, 1621. It
was consequently written just a year after the arrival
of the Pilgrims. It gives a very glowing account of
the prosperity of the colony, for it was written before
the facts were ascertained consequent upon the irruption
of the destitute adventurers in the Fortune. Its
statements can, of course, be relied upon, as coming
from one of the most illustrious of the Pilgrims, and
one who had taken a conspicuous part in the scenes
which he describes. It was as follows:</p>

<p class="p2 in0">“<span class="smcap">Loving and Old Friend</span>:</p>

<p>“Although I received no letter from you by this
ship,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> yet forasmuch as I know you expect the performance
of my promise, which was to write you
truthfully and faithfully of all things, I have therefore,
at this time, sent unto you accordingly, referring you
for further satisfaction, to our large “Relations.”</p>

<p>“You shall understand that, in the little time that
a few of us have been here, we have built seven<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
dwelling houses, and four for the use of the plantation,
and have made preparation for divers others.
We set, the last spring, some twenty acres of Indian
corn, and sowed some six acres of barley and pease.
And, according to the manner of the Indians, we manured
our ground with herrings, or rather shads,
which we have in great abundance, and take with
great ease at our doors.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Our corn did prove
well; and, God be praised, we had a good increase
of Indian corn, and our barley indifferent good; but
our pease were not worth the gathering, for we feared
they were too late sown. They came up very well and
blossomed, but the sun parched them in the blossom.</p>

<p>“Our harvest being gotten in, our governor
(Bradford) sent four men on fowling, that so we might,
after a special manner, rejoice together after we had
gathered the fruit of our labors. They four in one
day killed as much fowl as, with a little help beside,
served the company almost a week. At which time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
among other recreations, we exercised our arms, many
of the Indians coming amongst us, and, among the
rest, their greatest king, Massasoit, with some ninety
men, whom for three days we entertained and feasted,
and they went out and killed five deer, which they
brought to the plantation, and bestowed on our Governor
and the Captain, (Standish,) and others.”</p>

<p>In reference to this festival, we read, in the Life
of Elder Brewster: “The provisions for the little
colony being secured for the ensuing winter, their
Governor set apart a day for public thanksgiving.
Accordingly, with the fruits of their labors, the thankful
feast was prepared, that all might, in a special
manner, rejoice together, under a grateful sense of
these tokens of divine mercy. It was their first
thanksgiving or harvest festival in the New World.
And we may well conjecture what were the feelings
and what the theme of the Elder (Brewster), as, assembled
in their Common House, he led the devotions
of these worshippers, and spoke to them words
befitting the occasion.”</p>

<p>“We have found the Indians,” continues Mr.
Winslow, “very faithful in their covenant of peace
with us; very loving and ready to pleasure us. We
often go to them and they come to us. Some of us
have been fifty miles by land in the country with
them; the occasions and Relations whereof you shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
understand, by one general and more full declaration
of such things as are worth the noting. Yea, it hath
pleased God so to possess the Indians with a fear of
us, and love unto us, that not only the greatest king
among them, called Massasoit, but also all the princes
and peoples round about us, have either made suit
unto us, or been glad of any occasion to make peace
with us; so that seven of them, at once, have sent
their messengers to us to that end. Yea, an isle,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
at sea, which we never saw, hath also, together with
the former, yielded willingly to be under the protection,
and subjects to our sovereign lord, King James;
so that there is now great peace among the Indians
themselves, which was not formerly, neither would
have been but for us.</p>

<p>“We, for our parts, walk as peaceably and safely
in the woods as in the highways of England. We
entertain them familiarly in our houses, and they as
friendly bestow their venison upon us. They are a
people without any religion, or knowledge of any
God,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> yet very trusty, quick of apprehension, ripe
witted, just. The men and women go naked, only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
skin about their middles. For the temper of the air
here, it agreeth well with that of England. And if
there be any difference at all, this is somewhat hotter
in summer. Some think it to be colder in winter;
but I cannot, out of experience, so say. The air is
very clear and not foggy, as hath been reported.</p>

<p>“I never in my life remember a more seasonable
year than we have here enjoyed. And if we have
once but kine horses and sheep, I make no question
but men might live as contented here as in any part
of the world. For fish and fowl we have great abundance.
Fresh cod in summer is but coarse meat with
us. Our bay is full of lobsters all the summer, and
affordeth variety of other fish. In September we can
take a hogshead of eels in a night, with small labor,
and can dig them out of their beds all the winter.
We have muscles and clams<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> at our doors. Oysters
we have none near; but we can have them brought
by the Indians when we will. All the spring time the
earth sendeth forth naturally very good salid herbs.</p>

<p>“Here are grapes, white and red, and very sweet
and strong also; strawberries, gooseberries, raspberries,
etc.; plums of three sorts, white, black and
red, being almost as good as a damson; abundance
of roses, white, red and damask, single, but very
sweet indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
“The country wanteth only industrious men to
employ; for it would grieve your hearts if, as I, you
had seen so many miles together, by goodly rivers,
uninhabited, and withall to consider those parts of the
world wherein you live to be even greatly burdened
with abundance of people. These things I thought
good to let you understand, being the truth of things
as near as I could experimentally take knowledge of,
and that you might on our behalf give God thanks
who hath dealt so favorably with us.</p>

<p>“Our supply of men from you came the 9th of
November, 1621, putting in at Cape Cod, some eight
or ten leagues from us. The Indians, who dwell
thereabout, were they who were owners of the corn
which we found in caves, for which we have given
them full content, and are in great league with them.
They sent us word there was a ship near unto them,
but thought it to be a Frenchman; and, indeed, ourselves,
we expected not a friend so soon.</p>

<p>“But when we perceived she made for our bay,
the Governor commanded a great piece to be shot off,
to call home such as were abroad at work. Whereupon
every man, yea boy, that could handle a gun
was ready, with full resolution that, if she were an
enemy, we would stand in our just defense, not fearing
them. But God provided better for them than
we had supposed. These came all in health, not any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
being sick by the way, otherwise than by sea sickness,
and so continue, at this time, by the blessing of
God.</p>

<p>“When it pleaseth God we are settled and fitted
for the fishing business and other trading, I doubt not
but, by the blessing of God, the grain will give content
to all. In the mean time, that which we have
gotten we send by this ship; and though it be not
much, yet it will witness for us that we have not been
idle, considering the smallness of our number, all this
summer.</p>

<p>“Now, because I expect your coming unto us,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
with other of our friends, whose company we much
desire, I thought good to advise you of a few things
needful. Be careful to have a very good bread-room
to put your biscuits in. Let your cask for beer and
water be iron-bound, for the first tire, if not more.
Let not your meat be dry salted; none can better do
it than the sailors. Let your meal be so hard trod in
your cask that you shall need an adz or hatchet to
work it out with. Trust not too much on us, for corn
at this time, for by reason of this last company that
came, depending wholly upon us, we shall have little
enough till harvest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
“Be careful to come by some of your meal to
spend by the way. It will much refresh you. Build
your cabins as open as you can, and bring good store
of clothes and bedding with you. Bring every man a
musket or fowling-piece. Let your piece be long in
the barrel, and fear not the weight of it, for most of
our shooting is from stands. Bring juice of lemon,
and take it fasting; it is of good use. For hot waters,
aniseed water is the best; but use it sparingly. If
you bring anything for comfort in the country, butter
or sallet oil, or both, is very good. Our Indian corn,
even the coarsest, maketh as pleasant meat as rice;
therefore spare that, unless to spend by the way.
Bring paper and linseed oil for your windows, with
cotton yarn for your lamps. Let your shot be most
for big fowls, and bring store of powder and shot.”</p>

<p>The Pilgrims, it seems, had only oiled paper to
keep out the storms of a New England winter. Eight
years after this, the arts had made such progress that
Mr. Higginson in the year 1629, in a letter addressed
from Salem to his friends in England writes, “Be sure
to furnish yourselves with glass for windows.” Indeed,
glass windows were not introduced into England
until the year 1180. Then they were so costly that
none but the most wealthy could have them. Even
in the time of Henry VIII. they were considered a
luxury which the common people could not think of
enjoying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
One of the passengers in the Fortune, Mr. William
Hilton, in a letter addressed to his friends at
home, immediately after his arrival, having written in
glowing terms of the richness of the country and the
prospects of the colony, adds:</p>

<p>“We are all freeholders. The rent day doth not
trouble us; and all those good blessings we have of
which and what we list in their seasons for taking.
Our company are, for the most part, very religious,
honest people. The word of God is sincerely taught
to us every Sabbath; so that I know not anything a
contented mind can here want. I desire your friendly
care to send my wife and children to me, where I wish
were all the friends I have in England.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton’s family came in the next ship. Not
only had the Fortune brought no supply to the colonists,
but they were compelled to take from their own
rapidly diminishing stores to supply the ship’s crew
with provisions for her return voyage. Another winter
came. In the absence of all domestic animals
such as horses, mules, cows, oxen, sheep, there was
but little of the usual winter work of farmers which
remained for the Pilgrims to perform. Fishing, hunting
and the collection of fuel, which they drew with
their own hands to their doors, occupied the most of
their time.</p>

<p>On Christmas day rather an amusing event occurred,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
which has been recorded by Governor Bradford.
In the papal church and with the common people in
England, Christmas had become a day of revelry, carousing
and drunkenness. Ostensibly set apart as a
religious festival, the depravity of man had so perverted
it that, of all the days in the year, Christmas
was the one most utterly abandoned to wickedness.
Under these circumstances the Puritans, perhaps unwisely,
deemed it expedient to abolish the observance
of the day altogether.</p>

<p>On the morning of Christmas day the Governor,
as usual on other days, went out with the Pilgrims of
the Mayflower to their usual occupation in the fields.
But some of the new-comers, idle and frivolous, and
accustomed to the Christmas games of England, excused
themselves from going into the field, saying
that their consciences would not allow them to do any
work on Christmas day.</p>

<p>The Governor replied that if it were a matter of
conscience they might certainly be excused,—that he
did not wish that any persons in the colony should
have violence done to their religious convictions. He
therefore left these men at home, while he went, with
the rest of the colonists, to their daily toil. But when
they returned at noon, they found these scrupulous
men, whose consciences would not allow them to perform
any useful labor on Christmas day, out in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
streets engaged in all manner of old country sports.
They were pitching the bar, playing ball, and engaged
in games of petty gambling. Governor Bradford
went to them, and by virtue of his office, took away
from them their implements of gaming, saying:</p>

<p>“It is against my conscience that you should play
while others work. If your religious convictions constrain
you to observe Christmas, you should keep the
day religiously, at home or in the church. But there
must be no gambling or revelry on that day.”</p>

<p>This settled the question, and there were no more
demands for an idle or riotous Christmas.</p>

<p>Soon after the departure of the Fortune, in the
depth of winter, painful rumors came that the powerful
Narragansets, under their redoubtable Chief,
Canonicus, were assuming a threatening attitude.
The English had now about fifty men capable of bearing
arms, and not a large supply of ammunition. The
Narragansets could bring against them five thousand
warriors. They occupied the region extending from
the western shores of Narraganset Bay to Pawcatuck
River, and the tribe was estimated to number about
thirty thousand. The Pilgrims, all counted, men,
women and children, were less than one hundred in
number. This was a fearful cloud of war with which
they thus found themselves menaced.</p>

<p>While such was the position of affairs, one day a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
strange Indian entered the settlement. It soon appeared
that he was a Narraganset. He seemed not
a little embarrassed, and enquired for Squantum, the
interpreter. It seemed some relief to him to learn
that he was absent. He then left for him a bundle of
arrows, wrapped up in the skin of a rattlesnake, and
was hastily departing, when Governor Bradford, wishing
to know the significance of this strange conduct,
ordered Captain Standish to detain him. He was arrested
and entrusted to the safe keeping of Mr. Winslow
and Mr. Hopkins. Captain Standish gave orders
that he should be treated with the utmost kindness,
supplied with everything he needed, and while assured
that he should not be harmed, Mr. Winslow and Mr.
Hopkins should endeavor to obtain from him a full
and minute account of the object of his strange mission.</p>

<p>At first he was so terrified that he could scarcely
speak a word. But gradually regaining composure,
he stated that the messenger who had been sent to
the Pilgrims in the summer with terms of peace, had
brought back such tidings of the weakness of the colony
that Canonicus was encouraged to seek its destruction;
that he was angry in consequence of the
alliance of the colonists with his enemies, the Wampanoags;
that he professed to despise the meanness
of the presents sent to him by the Governor, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
scorned to receive them; and that the arrows and the
rattlesnake skin were to be understood as his declaration
of war.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice that this savage chieftain
should have had such a sense of honor as to send this
warning to his foes, instead of treacherously falling
upon them when unprepared. And it is also remarkable
that this challenge should have been so similar
to that which, in ancient days, the Scythian prince
sent to Darius, which consisted of five arrows.</p>

<p>When the Governor and Captain Standish were
informed of the results of the interview, they justly
regarded their captive as an innocent messenger,
whom, in accordance with all the laws of war, they
were to hold unharmed. They therefore, after offering
him food, which he refused to eat, set him at liberty,
directing him to say to Canonicus, that while
they wished to live at peace with all men, and while
they had done him no harm, they were indignant in
view of his threatenings, had no fear of his power, and
bade him defiance.</p>

<p>A violent storm was raging. But, notwithstanding
the storm and the entreaties of the Pilgrims, that
he would remain with them until it should abate, he
refused to accept of their hospitality, and soon disappeared,
travelling with all speed through one of the
trails of the drenched and surging forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
The Pilgrims held a council. It was deemed important
that no timidity whatever should be manifested,
but that they should present a bold front to
their foes. In the mean time Squantum had returned
to aid them with his counsel. After some deliberation,
they sent a friendly Indian, as a messenger, to
Canonicus, returning to him his rattlesnake skin, filled
with powder and bullets. This was a defiance which
would be understood. The superstitious savage chief
was quite alarmed by this response. Squantum, who
appears to have been quite a meddling, unscrupulous
man, had declared to the Indians that the English had
a box in which they kept the plague, and that if the
Indians offended them they would let the awful
scourge loose. They still retained a very vivid recollection
of the horrors of the pestilence which had
swept over them.</p>

<p>Canonicus feared that the snake-skin contained
some secret and fatal charm for his destruction. He
dared not touch it. He dared not attempt to destroy
it. He dared not allow it to remain in his house or
country. And thus it was conveyed from place to
place until finally it was returned whole to the colony
at Plymouth.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the brave attitude the colonists
had assumed, they had great cause for uneasiness.
They promptly decided that it was necessary to surround<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
the whole of their little village with a palisade
consisting of strong posts, ten or twelve feet high,
planted in the ground in contact with each other.
This palisade also included a portion of the top of the
hill, where their ordnance was planted, and at the
bottom of which their village was built. There were
three gates of entrance, which were locked every
night, and carefully guarded every day. Captain
Standish divided his whole force into four companies
of about twelve men each, and appointed a captain
over each band. A general muster was appointed,
which was the first general muster in New England.
At this gathering, Captain Standish reviewed his
troops and gave minute directions to each company
where to assemble and what to do in case of alarm.
The months of January and February were devoted
incessantly to fortifying their little village, the work
being completed early in March.</p>

<p>Captain Standish, in his visit to the Massachusetts,
had informed the natives that he would soon visit
them again, to purchase such furs as they might have
collected. It was deemed important now to fulfill
this promise, one principal object being to impress
the Indians with the conviction that the colonists had
no fear of them. It was also rumored to them that
the several tribes of Massachusetts Indians, and that
even their friends the Wampanoags, under Massasoit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
were entering into the confederacy of the Narraganset’s
against the white men. The friendly Indian,
Hobbomak, who resided with the Pilgrims at Plymouth,
seemed deeply impressed with the conviction
that the Massachusetts Indians were hostile, and assured
Captain Standish that should he attempt a journey
to Massachusetts, he would be surely cut off by the
savages. He gave many plausible reasons in support
of the correctness of his views, and even declared
that Squantum, in whom they reposed much confidence,
was treacherously their foe, aiding the Indians;
and that Squantum would endeavor to draw
them as far as possible from their shallop, that the
Indians might fall upon them and destroy them. He
however did not believe that Massasoit meditated any
treachery.</p>

<p>The Governor, Captain Standish, and few others
of the most judicious men held a council together,
and came to the following conclusion, which I give
in the words of Edward Winslow, who was one of the
council:</p>

<p>“That as hitherto, upon all occasions between the
Indians and us, we had ever manifested undaunted
love and resolution, so it would not now stand with
our safety to mew ourselves up in our new-enclosed
town; partly because our store was almost empty,
and therefore we must seek out our daily food, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
which we could not long subsist; but especially
that thereby they would see us dismayed and be encouraged
to prosecute their malicious purposes with
more eagerness than ever they had intended.</p>

<p>“Whereas, on the contrary, by the blessing of
God, our fearless carriage might be a means to discourage
and to weaken their proceedings. And therefore
we thought best to proceed in our trading voyage,
making this use of what we had heard, to go the better
provided, and use the more carefulness both at
home and abroad, leaving the event to the disposing
of the Almighty; whose providence, as it had hitherto
been over us for good, so we had now no cause, save
our sins, to despair of his mercy in our preservation
and continuance, where we desired rather to be instruments
of good to the heathen about us, than to
give them the least measure of just offense.”</p>

<p>In accordance with this resolve, early in April
Captain Standish took ten men, with Squantum and
Hobbomak as interpreters, and set out in the shallop
for what is now Boston harbor. In Plymouth bay
there is a remarkable promontory, connected with
Marshfield by a beach, now called Salt-house beach,
about six miles long. The extremity of this promontory
was call Gurnet’s Nose, from its resemblance to
a similar point of land on the coast of England. The
peninsula contains about twenty-seven acres of good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
land, and, upon its southern extremity, there have
since been erected two light-houses.</p>

<p>Just as the shallop was doubling Gurnet’s Nose,
an Indian, who was one of the family of Squantum,
came rushing in apparent terror, his face covered
with blood, to some of the Pilgrims at work in the
woods, looking behind him as if pursued, and calling
upon them to hasten with all possible speed within
the protection of the palisades. Breathlessly he told
them that at Namasket, now Middleborough, within
fifteen miles of Plymouth, a war party of Narragansets
and Wampanoags, united under Massasoit, the professed
friend, but treacherous foe, of the colonists, was
marching to attack them. He said that he had been
attacked and wounded for speaking friendly words in
behalf of the colonists, and that by breaking away he
had narrowly escaped death.</p>

<p>Upon receiving this startling intelligence, the Governor
ordered the cannon upon the hill to be instantly
discharged to recall the shallop. The day was calm,
the boat had been retarded in its progress, and the
report, booming over the still waters of the bay, reached
the ears of the crew just as the shallop was disappearing
around the point of Gurnet’s Nose. Captain
Standish immediately returned, the whole military
force of the colony was at once called into requisition,
and measures were adopted for a vigorous defense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
Upon the return of the shallop, Hobbomak, who
was with Captain Standish, declared, with great positiveness,
that the rumor was false. He said that he
was sure that Massasoit would prove faithful to his
pledges; that it was impossible that he could undertake
such an enterprise without communicating his
intentions to his sub-chiefs, of whom Hobbomak himself
was one of the principal. This tended rather to
increase the suspicions of the colonists that Squantum
might be playing a double part.</p>

<p>To ascertain the facts, the wife of Hobbomak, who
seems to have been a very intelligent and reliable
woman, was sent as a secret agent or spy to Pokanoket,
the seat of Massasoit, to inform herself respecting
the true posture of affairs, and to bring back a report.
Her difficult and important mission she performed
very creditably. Finding there everything
quiet, and no indication whatever of any hostile movement,
she frankly informed Massasoit of the rumors
which had reached the ears of the Pilgrims. He was
very indignant in being thus traduced, threw much
blame upon Squantum, and expressed his gratitude
that the Governor had not distrusted him. He requested
the squaw to assure the Governor that he
would prove faithful to his treaty obligations, and that
should he see any indications of hostility in any quarter
he would immediately give the Governor warning.</p>

<p class="hang">The Double-Dealing of Squantum.—False Alarm.—Voyage to Massachusetts.—Massasoit
Demands Squantum.—The Arrival of the
boat.—The Virginia Massacre.—Preparations for Defense.—Arrival
of the Charity and the Swan.—Vile Character of the Weymouth
Colonists.—Arrival of the Discovery.—Starvation at Weymouth.—Danger

<p>Speaking of the apprehended double-dealing of
Squantum, Mr. Winslow writes:</p>

<p>“Thus, by degrees, we began to discover Squantum,
whose ends were only to make himself great in
the eyes of his countrymen, by means of his nearness
and favor with us, not caring who fell so he stood. In
the general, his course was to persuade them he could
lead us to peace or war at his pleasure, and would oft
threaten the Indians, sending them word in a private
manner that we were intending shortly to kill them,
that thereby he might get gifts to himself to work
their peace; insomuch that they had him in greater
esteem than many of their sachems. So that whereas
divers were wont to rely on Massasoit for protection,
and resort to his abode, now they began to leave
him and seek after Squantum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
“Now, though he could not make good these, his
large promises, especially because of the continued
peace between Massasoit and us, he therefore raised
this false alarm, hoping, while things were hot in the
heat of blood, to provoke us to march into his country
against him; whereby he hoped to kindle such a
flame as would not easily be quenched; and hoping
if that block were once removed, there were no other
between him and honor, which he loved as his life, and
better than peace.”</p>

<p>The above is undoubtedly the true explanation of
the strange conduct of Squantum. The Governor
very severely reprimanded him for his trickery. Massasoit
was so indignant that he sent a messenger to
Plymouth, entreating that Squantum might be put to
death. The Governor admitted that he deserved
death, but he could not possibly be spared. As he
alone understood both languages, without him there
could scarcely be any intercourse between the Pilgrims
and the Indians.</p>

<p>“It was, perhaps,” writes Francis Baylies, “after
all, but natural for Squantum, who does not appear to
have possessed much influence with the natives, at
the time of the arrival of the English, to endeavor to
make the most of their favor. His knowledge of the
English language gave him a decided advantage over
all others. His own small tribe had been exterminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
by the plague. He was a solitary man, unaided
by the influence or favor of kindred, and he only used
the means which fortune had placed in his hands to
acquire wealth, consideration and influence. Another
of his devices, to magnify the power of the English,
and consequently his own, was to persuade the natives
that the English had buried the plague in their
store-house, and that they could loose it at will, and
ravage the whole country. The apprehension of this
kept the Indians in great fear.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The alarm created by this false rumor having subsided,
Captain Standish again set out with his party
to visit Massachusetts. It is to be regretted that we
have not a detailed account of the incidents which
occurred upon this voyage. The only record we have
is contained in the few following words, by Mr. Winslow:</p>

<p>“After this, we proceeded in our voyage to the
Massachusetts, where we had good store of trade;
and, blessed by God, returned in safety, though driven
from before our town in great danger and extremity
of weather.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Upon their return in May, they found Massasoit
still in a state of great excitement in reference to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
conduct of Squantum. By the treaty, which the English
had entered into with the Indian King, both parties
were bound to surrender criminals. Squantum,
as an adopted member of the Wampanoag tribe, was
a subject of Massasoit. The Indian chief now sent
an imposing delegation to Plymouth, formally demanding
the surrender of Squantum, that, in accordance
with Indian law, he might be put to death as a traitor.
With the delegation, he sent executioners to cut off
Squantum’s head and hands, and to bring them to him.
In token of his friendship for the English he sent to
the Governor a rich present of beaver skins.</p>

<p>Governor Bradford was much embarrassed. He
sent for Squantum. The culprit, though fully aware
of the object of the Indian envoys, and even that Massasoit
had sent his own knife, with which to cut off
his head and hands, made no effort to escape. With
true Indian stolidity he yielded himself to the Governor
to be delivered to death, or not, as he might think
best.</p>

<p>The terms of the treaty seemed clear. The Governor
decided that he could not, without violating his
solemn pledge, refuse to surrender Squantum to Massasoit.
He was just about to make this surrender,
which would have resulted in the immediate death of
the Indian, and which, of course, created the most intense
excitement in the little colony, when all were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
startled by the apparition of a shallop, under full sail,
rounding Hither Monomet Point, which constituted
the southern boundary of Plymouth Bay. A panic
pervaded the colony. It was feared that it was a
French boat, accompanying some French man-of-war,
and that they were approaching in concert with the
Indians for the destruction of the colony. Every man
sprang to arms. Captain Standish mustered his whole
force for defence. It might be that the hostile Indians
would rush upon them in an hour. There was
no doubt that Squantum, with all his great imperfections
of character, was the friend of the English. His
services as interpreter, under these circumstances,
became more important than ever. Governor Bradford
therefore informed the envoys that he could not
deliver Squantum to their custody. This roused their
indignation. “Being mad with rage,” writes Mr. Winslow,
“and impatient at delay, they departed in great
heat.”</p>

<p>It was soon ascertained, greatly to the relief of
the colonists, that the shallop belonged to an English
fishing vessel, called the Sparrow. The ship had been
fitted out by Mr. Thomas Weston, a London merchant,
and brought seven passengers to be landed at
Plymouth. The vessel, engaged in fishing, had cast
anchor at a place called Damari’s Cove, near Monhegan,
upon the coast of Maine, about one hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
twenty miles northeast from Plymouth. This was
famous fishing ground, and there were, at that time,
thirty-five vessels riding at anchor there. The Sparrow,
while most of her crew were engaged in fishing,
had sent her shallop to convey the seven passengers
to Plymouth.</p>

<p>The boat brought seven more mouths to be fed,
and no provisions. It was the last of May, 1622.
The colonial store of food was almost entirely consumed,
and for a long time the colonists had been
placed upon very short allowance. This boat brought
a very friendly letter from the captain of the Swallow,
John Huldston, communicating the startling intelligence
that the Indians in Virginia had risen against
the colony there on the 22d of March, and four hundred
of the Indians had been massacred. There could
be no doubt that this success of the Indians in Virginia
would be speedily communicated to all the
tribes; and that it would inspire the hostile Indians
in New England with the desire to imitate their example.</p>

<p>The crew of the shallop had barely provision sufficient
to serve them until their return to the ship.
The destitution of food in the colony was so great
that the colonists were threatened with absolute starvation.
The Governor therefore sent Mr. Winslow
in the shallop, with a small crew, to the fishing vessels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
to obtain from them, if possible, some supplies.
The boat from the Swallow led the way. The fishermen
were very generous. Though they had but a
scant supply of provisions for themselves, yet, with an
abundant store of fish on board, they were in no danger
of starving. They refused to take any pay for
the contributions they furnished to meet the wants of
the Pilgrims. Governor Bradford writes:</p>

<p>“What was got, and this small boat brought, being
divided among so many, came but to a little. Yet by
God’s blessing it upheld them till harvest. It arose to
but a quarter of a pound of bread a day to each person.
The Governor caused it to be daily given them;
otherwise, had it been in their own custody, they
would have eaten it up and then starved. But thus,
with what else they could get, they made pretty shift
until corn was ripe.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>The question naturally arises, How was it possible
that the colonists should find themselves in a state of
such utter destitution, in a country so overflowing
with abundance as Mr. Winslow’s letter has described,
where the forests were filled with game and the waters
with fish. We will allow Mr. Winslow himself to
reply to this question.</p>

<p>“I answer, everything must be expected in its proper
season. No man, as one saith, will go into an orchard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
in the winter to gather cherries. So he that looks
for fowl there, in the summer, will be disappointed.
The time they continue plenty with us is from the beginning
of October to the end of March. But these
extremities befell us in May and June. I confess that
as the fowl decrease, so fish increase. And, indeed,
their increasing abundance was a great cause of increasing
our wants. For, though our bays and creeks
were full of bass and other fish, yet, for want of fit
and strong seines, and other netting, they for the most
part broke through, and carried all away before them.
And, though the sea were full of cod, yet we had
neither tackling nor hawsers for our shallops. And,
indeed, had we not been in a place where divers sorts
of shell fish are, that may be taken with the hand, we
must have perished, unless God had raised some unknown
or extraordinary means for our preservation.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>Mr. Winslow, upon his return from the fishing
fleet, found the colony in great weakness. The hostile
Indians were not blind to this. The massacre in
Virginia had roused their savage natures, and many
insulting speeches, by them, were reported to the
English. Even Massasoit was disposed to frown, being
sorely displeased at their refusal to surrender
Squantum, according to the terms of the treaty.</p>

<p>The menaces of war had become so serious that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Captain Standish deemed it necessary immediately to
increase and strengthen their fortifications. They at
once set to work to build a strong fort upon Burial
Hill, within the limits of their palisades. It consisted
of a large, square building, with a strong flat roof,
made of thick planks, supported by oaken beams.
Upon this roof they placed their cannon, commanding
all the approaches. The large room below served
them for a church. Their mode of assembling for
public worship is described by Isaac de Rassieres, who
visited Plymouth in 1627:</p>

<p>“They assemble,” he writes, “by beat of drum,
each with his musket or firelock, in front of Captain
Standish’s door. They have their cloaks on, and
place themselves in order, three abreast, and are led
by a sergeant without beat of drum. Behind comes
the Governor, in a long robe. Beside him, on the
right hand, comes the preacher, with his cloak on;
and on the left hand the Captain, with his side arms
and cloak on, and with a small cane in his hand. And
so they march in good order, and each sets his arms
down near him.”</p>

<p>Early in July two trading ships from London, the
Charity and the Swan, entered Plymouth harbor.
These ships brought fifty or sixty emigrants, who intended
to settle in the country as the agents of a company
in England. It was their object to establish a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
colony to trade with the Indians. The expedition
was fitted out by Mr. Thomas Weston, a wealthy
merchant in London, and hence the new-comers were
generally called Weston’s men. Many of them were
utterly devoid of principle, profane and profligate.
Mr. Cushman wrote in reference to them:</p>

<p>“They are no men for us, and I fear that they will
hardly deal so well with the savages as they should.
I pray you, therefore, to signify to Squantum that
they are a distinct body from us, and we have nothing
to do with them, nor must be blamed for their faults,
much less can warrant their fidelity.”</p>

<p>Mr. John Pierce wrote respecting them: “As for
Mr. Weston’s company, they are so base in condition
for the most part, as in all appearance not fit for an
honest man’s company. I wish they might prove
otherwise.”</p>

<p>At the time of the arrival of these rude and hungry
adventurers, the Pilgrims had their gardens filled
with growing vegetables, and they had sixty acres
planted with corn, just then in the green ear. At
that time, when boiled or roasted, it made very palateable
food. But it was wasteful to use it in that
state unless there were great abundance. When ripened
it contained much more nutriment, and would
go much farther in feeding the hungry. But these
wretched men, though received hospitably by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
Pilgrims, and treated with the utmost kindness, requited
them by robbing their gardens and their cornfield.
Their little growing harvest was thus most
cruelly wasted. Indeed these godless wretches
seemed wantonly to destroy the growing crop. Having
no religion of their own, and only a God to swear
by, they insulted, with oaths and ribald jests, those
devout men, who daily looked in prayer to God for
guidance, and whose voices were often blended in
Christian hymns.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims seem to have been more grieved in
view of the influence the conduct of these men would
exert upon the savages, than by the outrages to which
they themselves were exposed. Mr. Winslow wrote:</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, for their master’s sake, who formerly
had deserved well from us,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> we continued to
do them whatever good or furtherance we could, attributing
these things to the want of confidence and
discretion, expecting each day when God, in his providence,
would disburden us of them, sorrowing that
their overseers were not of more ability and fitness
for their places, and much fearing what would be the
issue of such raw and unconscionable beginnings.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>The Charity, which was the larger ship, having
put these men ashore, continued her voyage to Virginia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
The rabble crew remained, an almost intolerable
burden upon the Pilgrims, during nearly all the
summer. An expedition was fitted out to explore
Massachusetts Bay, in search of a suitable location
for Mr. Weston’s colony. The expedition at length
returned, recommending a place in Boston harbor,
called by the Indians Wessagusset, but to which the
name of Weymouth was subsequently given.</p>

<p>Inexpressible was the satisfaction of the Pilgrims
when they saw these miscreants take their departure.
They however left behind them quite a number of
sick persons, whom the Pilgrims nursed with true
Christian benevolence, placing them under the care
of their own skilful physician, Dr. Fuller, and, as
they recovered, sending them, without any charge, to
their own distant colony.</p>

<p>But immediately after these men landed at Weymouth,
complaints came to the ears of the Pilgrims
of innumerable acts of violence and injustice which
they were perpetrating. They stole the corn of the
Indians, insulted their females in the grossest manner,
and in all things seemed to regard the Indians as
not entitled to any rights which white men were
bound to respect. The Pilgrims were the more annoyed
by these atrocities, since the Indians, disposed
to be friendly, had entreated Captain Standish to establish
a colony of white men in their country, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
could teach them many arts, and to whom they could
sell their corn and furs. Their outrages, reported
from tribe to tribe, tended also to exasperate everywhere
the undiscriminating Indians against the English.
But the Pilgrims had no power to redress these
abuses. They remonstrated earnestly; but their remonstrances
were in vain. The outrages were continued
unabated.</p>

<p>The Weston men had brought scarcely any supplies
with them. Before a month had passed they
were actually in a starving condition. They had no
harvest to gather in; winter was coming upon them,
and death by famine stared them in the face. To add
to their misery, anarchy reigned there, and the colony
consisted of a rabble of profane, ungovernable men,
in constant quarrels among themselves. These men
had also so wasted and consumed the supplies upon
which the industrious Pilgrims had been relying for
the winter, that the Plymouth colony was also in great
danger of perishing from want.</p>

<p>When in this alarming condition, and when the
minds of the Pilgrims were agitated with great anxiety
in view of the future, two ships, at the end of August,
came into Plymouth harbor. One of them, the Discovery,
was commanded by Captain Jones, formerly
of the Mayflower. The other was one of Mr. Weston’s
small fishing vessels, the Swan, which had returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
from a fishing expedition, and was bound for Virginia.
Providentially, Captain Jones had quite a large supply
of provisions. He had never been in cordial sympathy
with the Pilgrims, and now he very ungenerously
took advantage of their great necessities.
Though the Pilgrims were consequently compelled to
pay an exorbitant price for everything they obtained
of him, still they were enabled to purchase such supplies
as would save them from actual starvation. Mr.
Winslow writes:</p>

<p>“And had not the Almighty, in His all-ordering
providence, directed him to us, it would have gone
worse with us than ever it had been, or after was.
For as we had now but small store of corn for the
year following, so, for want of supply, we were worn
out of all manner of trucking stuff, not having any
means to help us by trade. But, through God’s good
mercy towards us, he had wherewith, and did supply
our wants, on that kind, competently.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>In consequence of the destitution of Mr. Weston’s
colony at Weymouth, the Swan was sent there,
with a considerable supply of provisions, and with articles
to trade with the Indians in exchange for corn.
The Swan was also left with the colony, to be used
for coasting purposes. But not a month had passed
before these reckless spendthrifts had squandered all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
their provisions, and were again starving. And they
were in such poor repute with the Indians that none
dared venture into the colony with corn to sell, lest
they should be robbed.</p>

<p>A man by the name of John Sanders was the
leading man, a sort of governor over the Weymouth
colony. He wrote to Governor Bradford, wishing to
unite with him in an excursion along the eastern and
southern coast of Cape Cod, to purchase corn of the
Indians. He would furnish the vessel for the voyage,
the Swan, but the colony at Plymouth must furnish
the men to trade with the Indians and the articles for
traffic. The corn was to be equally divided between
them. He promised to repay the Pilgrims for such
trading commodities as they should contribute, when
the next supplies came from Mr. Weston.</p>

<p>The promises of such a man were of but little
value. The Weymouth colony was already in a hopelessly
ruinous condition. But the Pilgrims were well
aware that they were daily in danger of an irruption
of the whole vagabond gang to eat out their substance,
and to fill their peaceful village with clamor
and violence. They had far more to fear from these
wretched colonists than from the savages. Policy
therefore, as well as humanity, urged it upon them to
do everything in their power to supply the wants of
Weston’s men, and thus keep them at a distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Captain Standish, with a small crew, took command
of the Swan for this trading expedition along
the outer coast of Cape Cod. Squantum accompanied
them as interpreter and pilot. They had
succeeded in reconciling Massasoit to him. They set
sail the latter part of September. But so violent a
gale arose that they were compelled to put back, having
suffered considerable harm. It took some time
to repair damages, when again they weighed anchor.
Squantum proved a very poor pilot. They were entangled
among the shoals, and retarded by contrary
winds; and, to add to their calamities, Captain Standish
was seized with a violent fever. Thus they were
compelled a second time to put back, not having accomplished
anything.</p>

<p>These delays brought them to the month of November.
The captain continuing quite sick, Governor
Bradford himself took command of the vessel. The
Governor had but little confidence in Squantum’s
knowledge of the coast. Still he had to look to him
alone, for no one else knew anything of the region.
At last, much bewildered and in peril, they ran into
an harbor with which Squantum was familiar, at a
place called, by the Indians, Manamocki, now Chatham.</p>

<p>The Governor, accompanied by a small party, with
Squantum for interpreter, went on shore that night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
But no Englishmen had visited the region before, and
the natives, terrified by the sight of the vessel, had
fled. Through Squantum, the Governor gradually
succeeded in making his friendly intentions known,
and cautiously they gathered around him. They
brought venison and corn in considerable abundance,
and seemed very glad to exchange them for the valuable
articles which Governor Bradford offered in return.
Still they manifested much fear of their visitors,
and were very unwilling to let them know where
their dwellings were. And when they found that the
Governor intended to remain on shore all night, they
suddenly disappeared, running to their wigwams, and
carrying all their valuables away with them.</p>

<p>Again, through the intervention of Squantum, confidence
was partially restored. The Governor was
so successful in his trade that he purchased of them,
though but a few and scattered people, eight hogsheads
of corn and beans. Such facts seemed to indicate
that all of the Indians did not depend so much
upon the chase for sustenance as has generally been
supposed. While thus engaged Squantum was taken
sick of a fever, and, after a few day’s illness, died. He
was heard to pray, and he asked Governor Bradford
to pray that God would take him to the heaven of the
Englishmen. All his valuables he bequeathed to his
English friends, as remembrances of his love. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
death was considered a great loss to the colony.
Judge Davis, commenting upon it, writes:</p>

<p>“Governor Bradford’s pen was worthily employed
in the tender notice of the death of this child of nature.
With some aberrations his conduct was generally
irreproachable; and his useful services to the infant
settlement entitle him to grateful remembrance.”</p>

<p>The death of Squantum left the Governor without
either pilot or interpreter. He did not venture,
therefore, to go any further south, where he would
encounter innumerable shoals, and where he would
find himself among strange Indians. These considerations
induced him to turn to the north. He was
acquainted with the waters of Massachusetts Bay,
and the Indians residing on those shores were in
friendly relations with the Pilgrims. Indeed, they
had been induced to plant more corn than usual, that
they might have the means to purchase the valuable
articles which the Pilgrims could offer them in exchange.</p>

<p>With a fair wind they soon entered Boston harbor.
Here they found, to their grief, a fearful pestilence
raging among the Indians, and many of them were
dying. Bitter complaints were also brought to the
Governor respecting the Weymouth colonists. The
Massachusetts Indians were so exasperated by the
infamous conduct of these men, that they were plotting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
for their utter extermination, many intending to
follow up the massacre of the Weymouth colonists
by the destruction of the Plymouth colony also.
They were in no mood for peaceful traffic.</p>

<p>The Governor, therefore, speedily weighed anchor
and spread his sails for Nauset, on the inner shore
of Cape Cod. It will be remembered that the Pilgrims
had formerly found some corn stored there,
which, in their great need they took, but for which
they afterwards fully paid the Indians. Captain
Standish had also visited the region in search of the
lost boy. Aspinet, the chief of the tribe, residing
there, was very friendly. They landed in a small bay,
between Barnstable and Yarmouth harbors. They
had hardly made their port when a terrible storm
arose. The gale was so furious that, notwithstanding
their shelter, they came very near shipwreck. The
shallop, attached to the Swan, was torn from them
and driven they knew not where. This was a great
calamity. The shoal water rendered it necessary to
cast anchor at some distance from the shore, according
to their estimate nearly six miles, and they had
now no means of bringing on board such provisions as
they might purchase. They had indeed one small
boat, but it was so small and leaky that they scarcely
ventured to go ashore in it, even in the most pleasant
weather, for wood and water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
The Governor, however, opened a very successful
trade with the Indians. He seems to have had much
confidence in their honesty, for, having purchased a
large quantity of corn, he stored it away, simply covering
it with mats, and hired a neighboring Indian to
watch and protect it from vermin till he could return
and fetch it. In the meantime Aspinet had sent his
men to traverse the shore in search of the shallop,
which the storm had wrenched from them. It was
found at the distance of several miles, much broken,
and half buried in the sand at high water mark. It
was entirely unserviceable until it should be repaired
by a ship carpenter, and there was no carpenter on
board the Swan.</p>

<p>The Governor, for some unexplained reason, decided
to return to Plymouth by land, a distance of
fifty miles. He took with him a single Indian guide,
and traversing the wilderness on foot through the Indian
trails, reached Plymouth in safety, weary and
footsore. The Indians on the way treated him with
great respect and hospitality. Three days after his
arrival the Swan entered the harbor, and the portion
of corn she had brought, which, by the division, belonged
to the Weymouth colony, was immediately
sent in the vessel to them.</p>

<p>Captain Standish having now recovered his health,
took another shallop and a ship carpenter, and sailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
in the Swan, which came back to Plymouth from
Weymouth, across the bay to Nauset, to fetch the
corn which they had stored there, and to repair and
bring home the wrecked shallop. He found all safe.
While the carpenter was repairing the shallop, he was
busy with the other boat, transporting the corn out
to the vessel, which, as we have mentioned, it was
necessary to anchor at quite a distance from the
shore.</p>

<p>It was the month of January, cold and stormy.
The exposure and the labor were painful, for often the
sea was very rough. The coast of Eastham, off which
the Swan lay, abounds with creeks. Into one of
these the shallop ran to take in its load. While in
the creek one day, an Indian stole some beads, scissors,
and other trifles from the boat. Captain Standish
took one or two of his men with him, and going
to the sachem, demanded the restitution of the articles,
or he should take the law into his own hands
and obtain redress. With this menace he left the
chief, refusing to receive any hospitality from him.
It so happened that the thief was known, and the sachem
could, without difficulty, restore the stolen articles,
were he disposed to do so.</p>

<p>The next morning Aspinet came to Captain
Standish with a very imposing retinue. Both he and
his men saluted the Captain, in the style of Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
homage, kissing his hand, indeed licking it, and bowing
the knee very humbly before him. He then delivered
up all the articles which had been taken, expressed
his deep regret at the occurrence, and assured
Captain Standish that the thief had been severely
beaten for his crime. In token of his regret and
friendship, the Indian women were ordered to bring
to the Captain quite a supply of freshly-baked corn
bread.</p>

<p>The Swan returned to Plymouth with about twenty-eight
hogsheads of corn and beans, which were
equally divided between the two colonies, as before.
In the two colonies there were now about one hundred
and fifty hungry mouths to be fed. Of course
such a supply would soon disappear. It became immediately
necessary to fit out new expeditions in
search of food.</p>

<p>The Governor soon took one or two men and went
to Middleborough, the Namasket of the Indians, to
purchase corn. It all had to be brought home in
sacks upon the back. The Indian women aided in
transporting it. The Pilgrims were astonished to see
what burdens they would bear. “It is almost incredible,”
writes Roger Williams, “what burdens the poor
women carry of corn, of fish, of beans, of mats, and a
child besides.” An Indian woman, of small stature,
would take a hundred weight of corn upon her shoulders
and trudge through the wilderness for miles
without resting. But a small supply of corn could be
obtained at Namasket.</p>

<p>The Governor then took an inland trip of sixty
miles to an Indian settlement called Manomet, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
head of Buzzard’s Bay. The distance across the cape
here to Massachusetts Bay is but six miles. They
could, after that short land carriage, by an easy voyage
in the boats, transport their corn to Plymouth.
Here the Governor purchased quite a supply, which
he left in the custody of the sachem, Canacum, until
the boats could be sent to fetch it. While here, an
incident occurred which is worthy of record, as illustrative
of Indian customs:</p>

<p>It was the month of February. The night was
bitterly cold, a fierce storm raging. The Governor
was in the snug wigwam of the sachem, sitting by the
bright fire blazing in the centre of the hut. Two
stranger Indians entered. Without speaking a word
they laid aside their bows and arrows, sat down upon
the mats by the fire, took out their pipes and began
to smoke. Having finished their pipes, one of them
made a short address of greeting to the chief, and
presented him with a basket containing tobacco and
some beads. The chief received the gift graciously.
The Indian then, in quite a long speech, delivered his
message, which was interpreted to the Governor by
Hobbomak. It was as follows:</p>

<p>Two Indians of the tribe to which the messengers
belonged, while gambling, quarrelled, and one killed
the other. The murderer was a man of special note,
and one who could not be well spared. His chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
was unwilling to order his execution. But the sachem
of another powerful tribe had declared that unless he
put the offender to death he would wage war against
him with all his force. The chief therefore desired
the advice of his powerful friend, Canacum, as to the
course it was proper for him to pursue.</p>

<p>There was then, for some time, silence. At length
Canacum asked the opinion of all who were present.
When Hobbomak was questioned, he said: “I am a
stranger; but it seems to me better that one should
die than many, especially since that one deserves
death, and the many are innocent.” Canacum then
directed the messengers to inform their sachem that
in his opinion the murderer should be put to death.</p>

<p>The Governor returned to Plymouth, intending to
send Captain Standish in the shallop, to fetch the
corn which he had purchased. Just after his arrival,
a messenger came from John Sanders, in Weymouth,
stating that the colonists there were actually in a
starving condition; that they could obtain no corn
from the Indians, as the Indians would not lend it to
them, and that they had no means of buying. Under
these circumstances he said that he should be under
the necessity of taking it from them by force. Weak
as the colonists were, by the aid of powder and bullets,
they could, without difficulty, rob the comparatively
defenceless Indians. The Governor remonstrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
in the strongest terms against this plan of robbery.
He assured Sanders that such an act would
inevitably combine all the tribes in a coalition against
both colonies, and might lead to the utter extirpation
of the English from this continent. From his own
scanty store of corn he sent to Weymouth a small
supply, entreating them to make shift to live, as they
did at Plymouth, upon ground-nuts, clams, and muscles.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Captain Standish took the shallop
and sailed to Sandwich harbor, to get the corn
which the Governor had purchased and ordered to be
stored there. It was in the severest of winter weather.
Icy gales swept the ocean, and dashed the surge upon
the snow-drifted beach. They succeeded in entering
the harbor, but the first night they were frozen up
there. The outrageous conduct of the Weymouth
colonists, and the threats which they had openly uttered
of their intention to rob the Indians, had spread
far and wide, producing great exasperation; and the
natives who were adverse to the colonists were taking
advantage of it to form a general coalition against
them.</p>

<p>Captain Standish, upon landing, perceived at once
that there was a change coming over the minds of
the Indians. The friendliness they affected appeared
to him constrained and insincere. He was frozen in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
and large numbers of Indians began to gather around
him, some manifestly unfriendly; and there were not
a few indications that a conspiracy was being formed
for his destruction. The weather was so cold that
the Pilgrims could not sleep in the shallop, but were
constrained to accept the shelter and the fires found
in the Indian wigwams.</p>

<p>The captain was not a man to be taken by guile.
Avoiding all display of his suspicions, he gave strict
charge that a part of the company should always
watch by night while the rest slept. Some of the
Indians stole several articles from the boat. Captain
Standish immediately marched his whole force of six
men, and surrounded the wigwam of the sachem,
where many of the most prominent of the Indians
were assembled. He then sent in word to the sachem
that as he would not allow himself, or any of his men,
to be guilty of the slightest injustice towards the Indians,
neither would he submit to any injustice from
them; that he held the sachem responsible for the
stolen goods, and that unless they were immediately
restored he should obtain redress by force of arms.</p>

<p>The crafty sachem sent agents who, without difficulty,
obtained the goods and secretly conveyed them
to the shallop. He then told Captain Standish that
probably he had overlooked them, and he thought
that if he should look more carefully he would find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
that they were all there. The captain, understanding
this, sent to the shallop, and there the stolen goods
were, lying openly upon the boat’s cuddy. The sachem
however was much alarmed by this decision and boldness
manifested by the captain. In endeavors to win
back his favor he brought to him quite an additional
quantity of corn to sell. The captain loaded down
his shallop with the treasure; and, a southerly wind
freeing the harbor of ice, he returned in safety to
Plymouth.</p>

<p>A portion of this supply was forwarded to Weymouth.
It soon, however, was consumed, and, impelled
by want, in March, Captain Standish again
took the shallop and returned to Manomet, hoping to
get an additional supply of food. He met with a
chilling reception, and with increasing evidence that
the Indians were plotting against the colonists. He
soon found the explanation of this. Leaving three
men in charge of the shallop, he took three with him,
and went to the wigwam of Canacum, the sachem.
While there, two Massachusett Indians came in. They
were from the immediate vicinity of Weymouth, violent
and hostile men, and had come to Canacum to
engage him and his warriors in a coalition against the
English.</p>

<p>“The chief of them,” writes Mr. Winslow, “was
called Wituwamat, a notable insulting villain, one who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
had formerly imbued his hands in the blood of English
and French, and had often boasted of his own
valor, and derided their weakness, especially because,
as he said, they died crying, making sour faces, more
like children than men.”</p>

<p>This boastful fellow, in the presence of Captain
Standish, presented Canacum with a dagger, which
he had obtained from the Weymouth men. He then
addressed him in a long speech, in a language which
he knew that the Captain could not understand, but
in a tone and with gestures which could not but be
considered insulting. The purport of this address,
as afterwards interpreted, was as follows:</p>

<p>We have decided to exterminate the weak and
starving colony at Weymouth. We are strong enough
to do it any day. But we fear that the colony at
Plymouth will avenge the death of their countrymen.
It is therefore necessary to destroy both colonies.
To do this we must unite our tribes against them.
We now come to solicit your aid. The redoubtable
Captain of the Plymouth colony is now with you, with
six of his men. They can all easily be killed. This
will make our work easy.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>Canacum was evidently impressed by this speech.
He neglected Captain Standish, and treated his Indian
guest with marked distinction. A plot was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
formed for the assassination of the whole boat’s crew.
The Indians stood in deadly fear of the muskets of
the English, and did not dare approach the shallop
with hostile intent. The Captain did not allow any
armed men to draw near them. The Indians tried to
lure them all on shore, saying that it was too cold for
them to sleep in the shallop. They hoped to fall
upon them, in sudden massacre, while asleep in the
huts. With this purpose in their hearts they feigned
great friendship, made presents to Captain Standish,
and with alacrity aided in carrying corn to the shallop.
The Captain evaded all their wiles, and a fair
wind soon bore him back again to his friends.</p>

<p>While he was absent, word came to Plymouth that
Massasoit was very dangerously sick, and that his
death was daily expected; and also that a Dutch ship
had been driven ashore almost opposite his dwelling.
It was a custom with the Indians that when any chief
was sick, all his friends should hasten to visit him.
In observance of this custom, and also to obtain some
intercourse with the Dutch, and hoping also to secure
the friendship of the neighboring sachems, it was decided
that Mr. Winslow and Mr. Hampden, with
Hobbomak as a guide, should visit the dying chief at
his home in Paomet.</p>

<p>It was a perilous journey in the then unsettled
state of affairs. It was not known who of the Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
were friendly, and who were hostile. The death of
Massasoit might bring the hostile party into power,
and then there would be hardly a possibility that the
two envoys could escape with their lives. Hobbomak,
who had embraced Christianity, and was apparently a
consistent Christian, seemed to be deeply grieved in
view of the death of his chief. He said to Mr. Winslow,</p>

<p>“I shall never see his like again. He was no
liar; he was not bloody and cruel, like other Indians.
In anger and passion he was soon reclaimed. He
was easy to be reconciled to those who had offended
him. Ruled by reason, he scorned the advice of
mean men, and governed his people better with few
strokes than others did with many. When he is gone
the English will not have a true and faithful friend
left among the Indians.”</p>

<p>Massasoit had two sons, Wamsutta and Pometacom.
According to Indian usage, upon the death of
the father, the eldest son inherited the chieftainship.
But it was feared that Corbitant, who had already
manifested hostility, and in whose assumed reconciliation
but little reliance could be placed, would by
violence grasp the power, and bring the whole weight
of the tribe against the colonists.</p>

<p>The deputation traveled the first day as far as the
little Indian hamlet of Namasket, which, it will be
remembered, occupied the present site of Middleborough.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
They passed the night in the wigwam of an
Indian. The next day they continued their journey
to Mattapoisit, in the present town of Swanzey. Here
Corbitant resided. The rumor had already reached
them that Massasoit was dead. There were indications
that Corbitant had already taken steps as an
usurper, and there were serious apprehensions that
the two defenceless Englishmen would immediately
fall victims to his hostile policy.</p>

<p>The two envoys, however, to avoid all appearance
of suspicion, went directly to Corbitant’s house. The
sachem was not at home, but his wife received them
kindly. They sent forward an Indian runner to Paomet,
to bring them back tidings respecting the condition
of Massasoit. He returned with the tidings
that the chief was still living when he left, but was
expected every moment to die. They hurried on, and
reached Paomet late at night. In the following terms
Mr. Winslow describes his visit to the dying chief:</p>

<p>“When we came thither we found the house so
full of men as we could scarce get in, though they
used their best diligence to make way for us. There
were they in the midst of their charms for him, making
such a hellish noise as it distempered us that were
well, and therefore unlike to ease him that was sick.
About him were six or eight women, who chafed his
arms, legs and thighs, to keep heat in him. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
they had made an end of their charming, one told
him that his friends, the English, were come to see
him. Having understanding left, but his sight being
wholly gone, he asked who was come. They told him
<em>Winsnow</em>, for they cannot pronounce the letter <em>l</em>, but
ordinarily <em>n</em> in the place thereof. He desired to speak
with me. When I came to him, and they told him of
it, he put forth his hand to me, which I took. Then
he said twice, though very inwardly, <em>Keen Winsnow</em>,
which is to say, Art thou Winslow? I answered,
<em>Ah he</em>, that is, Yes. Then he doubled these words,
<em>Matta neen wonckanet namen, Winsnow</em>! that is to
say, O Winslow, I shall never see thee again.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>Mr. Winslow then informed the dying chief,
through Hobbomak, that the Governor was sorry to
hear of his sickness, and would have visited him in
person had not important business prevented; that
he had consequently sent Mr. Winslow and Mr.
Hampden in his stead, with such medicines as the
English used in case of sickness. Mr. Winslow administered
these medicines, which proved so wonderfully
efficacious that soon his patient quite revived,
his sight was restored, and he was able to take some
refreshing broth. All the Indians were surprised
and delighted by the change. Two Indians were
sent to Plymouth for more medicine, and for two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
chickens for broth. They were dispatched at two
o’clock in the morning, bearing letters informing the
Governor of the success of their mission. Mr. Winslow
gives the following account of his medical practice
on this important occasion:</p>

<p>“He requested me that, the day following, I would
take my piece and kill him some fowl, and make him
some English pottage, such as he had eaten at Plymouth.
After, his stomach coming, I must needs
make him some without fowl, before I went abroad.
This somewhat troubled me, being unacquainted and
unaccustomed in such business, especially having
nothing to make it comfortable, my consort being as
ignorant as myself. But being we must do somewhat,
I caused a woman to bruise some corn and take the
flour from it, and set over the broken corn in a pipkin,
for they have earthen pots of all sizes.</p>

<p>“When the day broke we went out, it being now
March, to seek herbs, but could not find any but
strawberry leaves, of which I gathered a handful and
put into the same. And because I had nothing to
relish it, I went forth again and pulled up a sassafras
root, and sliced a piece thereof and boiled it till it had
a good relish, and then took it out again. The broth
being boiled, I strained it through my handkerchief,
and gave him at least a pint, which he liked very well.
After this his sight mended more and more; and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
took some rest, insomuch that we with admiration
blessed God for giving his blessing to such raw and
ignorant means; making no doubt of his recovery,
himself and all of them acknowledging us the instruments
of his preservation.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>The grateful chief requested Mr. Winslow to visit
all the sick in his village, and to administer to them
the same remedies which had been so available in his
case. With true Christian philanthropy Mr. Winslow
undertook this task, finding it needful to perform
many revolting offices, from which he did not shrink.
With the utmost tenderness he watched the fluctuations
of the disease of the king, and administered
remedies apparently with much intuitive skill. Having
succeeded in shooting a duck, just before the
men returned with the pigeons, Massasoit decided to
preserve them alive for breed. His recovery excited
so much astonishment that many persons came a hundred
miles to see him. Great efforts had been made
by the hostile Indians to prejudice him against the
English, and to induce him to join their coalition.</p>

<p>“Now I see,” he said, “that the English are my
friends, and love me. And whilst I live I will never
forget this kindness they have showed me. They
have been more kind to me than any others have
been.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
As Mr. Winslow was leaving, Massasoit called
Hobbomak privately to him, one or two of his warriors
only being present, and informed him in full of
the plot of the Massachusetts Indians to destroy the
Weston colony, and then to attack that at Plymouth.
He mentioned seven tribes who were united with
them in the coalition, among others mentioning some
who were making loud professions of friendship. He
said that he had been earnestly solicited to join them,
but that he would not do so, neither would he allow
any of the tribes under his sway to make any hostile
movement.</p>

<p>Massasoit advised the pilgrims, through Hobbomak,
that if they would save the lives of their countrymen,
they should immediately put to death the leading
men of the Massachusetts tribes who were organizing
this formidable conspiracy. “Say to them,”
said he, “that they often say that they will never
strike the first blow. But if they wait until their
countrymen at Weymouth are killed, who are entirely
unable to defend themselves, it will then be too late
for them to protect their own lives. I therefore advise
them, without any delay, to put the leaders of
this plot to death. Communicate what I say to you
to Mr. Winslow, on your way home, that he may relate
the same to Governor Bradford.”</p>

<p>Very affectionately the two parties took leave of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
each other. The envoys were disappointed in not
meeting the Dutch; but the day before their arrival,
a high tide enabled them to move the ship from the
shoals, upon which it had been stranded, and they
had proceeded on their voyage. The Pilgrims called
upon Corbitant on their return, and passed the night
with him. He received them with great apparent
cordiality. Mr. Winslow gives the following pleasing
account of the visit.</p>

<p>“I had much confidence with him; he being a
notable politician, yet full of merry jests and quibs,
and never better pleased than when the like are returned
upon him. Among other things he asked me, if
in case he were thus dangerously sick, as Massasoit had
been, and should send word thereof to Plymouth for
medicine, whether the Governor would send it; and
if he would, whether I would come therewith to him.
To both which I answered, yea; whereat he gave me
joyful thanks.</p>

<p>“After that, he demanded further how we durst,
being but two, come so far into the country. I
answered, where was true love there was no fear;
and my heart was so upright towards them that,
for my own part, I was fearless to come amongst
them.</p>

<p>“‘But,’ said he, ‘if your love be such, and it bring
forth such fruits, how cometh it to pass that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
we come to Plymouth, you stand upon your guard,
with the mouths of your pieces presented towards
us.’</p>

<p>“Whereupon I answered it was the most honorable
and respective entertainment we could give them,
it being an order amongst us so to receive our best
respected friends. And as it was used on the land,
so the ships also observed it at sea, which Hobbomak
knew and had seen observed. But, shaking his head,
he answered that he liked not such salutations.”</p>

<p>Noticing that Mr. Winslow asked a blessing upon
his food, and returned thanks after partaking of it, he
asked him the meaning of the custom. He listened
very attentively to Mr. Winslow’s account of the ten
commandments and of the Christian religion, and expressed
his cordial approval of nearly all. The next
day the Pilgrims continued their journey, and lodged
that night at Middleborough. The next day, when
they had reached about half way home, they met two
Indians, who informed them that Captain Standish
had that morning set sail for Massachusetts, but that
contrary winds had driven him back. Upon their
arrival, they found Captain Standish waiting for a fair
wind to resume his voyage.</p>

<p>It was the latter part of February. The news
from the Weston colony was continually becoming
more disastrous. These wretched adventurers were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
sinking into degradation almost beneath that of the
savages. John Sanders had taken the Swan, and,
with a small crew, had sailed for the coast of Maine,
hoping to obtain some food from the fishermen there.
The religionless rabble, left behind, sold their clothes
and bed coverings for food. They became servants
to the insolent Indians, cutting wood and bringing
water to them for a cup full of corn. They stole,
night and day, from the Indians. Several died from
cold and hunger. One man was digging clams. He
got stuck in the mud, and was so weak that he could
not extricate himself, and miserably perished. They
scattered, wandering about in search of ground nuts
and shell-fish, and became utterly despicable, even in
the eyes of the savages.</p>

<p>“They became contemned and scorned by the
Indians,” writes Governor Bradford, “and they began
greatly to insult over them in the most insolent manner;
insomuch, many times, as they lay thus scattered
abroad, and had set on a pot with ground nuts
or shell-fish, when it was ready, the Indians would
come and eat it up. And when night came, whereas
some of them had a sorry blanket or such like to lap
themselves in, the Indians would take it, and let the
others lie all night in the cold; so as their condition
was very lamentable. Yea, in the end they
were fain to hang one of their men, whom they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
could not reclaim from stealing, to give the Indians
content.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>A waggish report was circulated, with which Hudibras
makes himself merry, that, the thief being a man
of some importance, who could not well be spared, a
poor decrepit old man, who was utterly unserviceable,
was hung in his stead. There was no truth in this
report. And it was still more atrocious, as a calumny,
when attributed to the Pilgrims. It cannot be denied,
however, that the deed would have been in character
with the conduct of the Weymouth miscreants. They
were not Puritans. There is no evidence that they
had any church, any divine worship, or any religion.</p>

<p>The state of the Weston colony caused much
anxiety at Plymouth. The savages were learning to
despise the English. It was necessary to take some
very decisive action, and yet it was difficult to determine
what that action should be. Captain Standish’s
voyage was delayed, to wait for further developments,
and many consultations were held. At length,
on the 23d of March, the Governor assembled the
whole company of the Pilgrims in general council,
and, expressing the deepest regret that it seemed to
be necessary to resort to warlike measure against
those whose good only they sought to promote, proposed
that Captain Standish should take so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
well-armed men as he judged to be necessary, and,
assailing the Indians with the same weapons of guile
which they were persistently using, should go to Massachusetts
as if for trade with the Indians. On the
way he was to visit Weymouth and inform the people
there of the plot which was formed against them, and
of the object of his coming, and to invite them to embark
on board the Swan, and come to Plymouth for
protection. He was then to visit the Indians, carefully
scrutinize their conduct, and adopt such measures
to thwart their plans and punish their ringleaders as
in his judgment might seem expedient. He was particularly
requested to bring back with him, as a warning
to all the savages, the head of that bold and bloody
villain Wituwamat, of whom we have before spoken,
who was loud and boastful in his threats, and undisguised
in his measures to array all the Indians against
the English.</p>

<p>Captain Standish took eight men only, selecting
those in whose courage and discretion he could repose
perfect reliance. The day before he was to sail, a
man by the name of Phineas Pratt came from Weymouth,
through the woods, with his pack upon his
back. He brought a deplorable report of the degradation
and helplessness of the colonists. They were
dispersed in three companies in search of food, and
were almost destitute of powder and shot. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
fled from the impending ruin, and begged permission
to remain at Plymouth.</p>

<p>The next day the wind was fair, and Captain
Standish set sail on his difficult and perilous expedition.
They entered the harbor at Weymouth, and
proceeded first to the Swan, which was at anchor
there, “but neither man, or so much as a dog therein.”
The discharge of a musket attracted the attention
of the master of the vessel, who was on shore,
with some of the colonists, searching for ground nuts.
Upon Captain Standish reproaching them with their
carelessness in leaving a vessel so important to their
safety thus exposed, they replied, like men bereft of
reason, that they had no fear of the Indians. The
Captain gathered around him as many of the colonists
as he could, and informed them of the plot already
ripe for their massacre. He then gave them the invitation,
on the part of the Governor and all the colonists,
to repair to Plymouth, where they would share
their scanty food with them until some better plan for
their welfare could be devised. A more heroic act
of hospitality than this the world has seldom witnessed.
He also added that if there were any other
plan which they preferred to adopt, he would do everything
in his power to aid them in it.</p>

<p>These wretched men gladly accepted the generous
offer which rescued them from the tomahawk of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
savage, and decided at once to abandon the colony.
Captain Standish then enjoined upon them the most
entire secrecy in respect to their contemplated movement.
The stragglers were all to be immediately
called in, and ordered not to leave the town under
penalty of death. A pint of corn was allotted to
them each day, though this had to be taken from the
store which the Pilgrims had reserved for planting.</p>

<p>The weather was cold, wet and stormy, and thus
Captain Standish was much delayed in his operations.
The Indians, hearing of the arrival of the shallop
from Plymouth, sent a spy to Weymouth, ostensibly
to sell some furs. Though the Captain treated him
with the customary courtesy, the sagacious savage
returned with the report that “he saw, by his eyes,
that he was angry in his heart.” But the Indians had
become so emboldened that they hesitated not to use
any language of insolence and menace. One of the
vilest of them, a fellow of gigantic stature, by the
name of Pecksuot, with Wituwamat and his brother,
came swaggering into the little village. “Tell your
Captain,” said he, “that we know that he has come to
kill us. But we do not fear him. Let him begin as
soon as he dares. We are ready for him.”</p>

<p>These three men, with another Indian, followed
by quite a mob of the savages, entered one of the
houses, where Captain Standish was with four of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
Pilgrims. The object, evidently, was to provoke a
quarrel, and murder the Englishman. Captain Standish
was a slender man, of small stature. Pecksuot
was almost a giant. The savage approached him,
whetting his knife, and boasting of his power to lay
the “little man” low. The other Indians were equally
insulting and threatening, with both word and gesture.
The Captain, perfectly preserving his calmness
and self-possession, ordered the door to be shut
and fastened, that no other Indians could come in.
Then, giving the signal to the others of his men, he
sprang, with the wonderful strength and agility for
which he was celebrated, upon the burly savage,
wrenched the knife, which was sharp as a needle at
the point, from his hand, and after a desperate conflict,
in which he inflicted many wounds, succeeded in
plunging it to the hilt in the bosom of his foe. In
like manner Wituwamat and the other Indian, after
the fiercest struggle, during which not a word was
uttered, were killed. Wituwamat’s brother, a boastful,
blood-thirsty villain of eighteen, was taken and
hanged, for conspiring for the massacre of the English.</p>

<p>The Indians around the house, appalled by so unexpected
an exhibition of courage and power, fled
into the wilderness. Captain Standish marshalled his
whole force to pursue. The Indians rallied in an advantageous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
position, and made a brief stand. But,
three of their number falling before the bullets of the
Englishmen, they again turned, and on swift foot disappeared.</p>

<p>The Weymouth men, aware of their danger of
suffering from hunger in Plymouth, decided to embark
in the Swan for the fishing fleet on the coast,
hoping there to obtain provisions to enable them to
return to England. It was probably an acceptable
decision to the Captain. Retaining simply corn
enough for his homeward trip, he gave all the rest he
had with him to them. A few decided to go to Plymouth,
whom the Captain took with him. Having
seen the Swan set sail, and fairly clear of Massachusetts
Bay, the conquering hero spread his sail,
and was soon greeted by his friends for his success
in his chivalric adventure. Thus the godless colony
at Weymouth came to an ignoble end.</p>

<p>When the Rev. Mr. Robinson, the Pilgrims’ former
pastor in Holland, heard of these sanguinary scenes,
he was greatly afflicted. Captain Standish was not
a church member, and Mr. Robinson feared that he
had acted with the impetuosity of the soldier, and not
with the forbearance of the Christian. He wrote to
the Pilgrims:</p>

<p>“It is necessary to bear in mind the disposition
of your captain, whom I love, who is of a warm temper.
I had hoped that the Lord had sent him among
you for good, if you used him right. He is a man
humble and meek among you, and towards all in ordinary
course. But I doubt whether there is not
wanting that tenderness of the life of man, made after
God’s image, which is meet. O how happy a thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
had it been that you had converted some before you
had killed any.”</p>

<div id="ip_233" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.625em;">

  <div class="caption"><i>KITCHEN OF STANDISH HOUSE.</i></div></div>

<p>To this it was replied that two of the Indians,
Squantum and Hobbomak, it was hoped, had already
become Christians; that Captain Standish was the
military commander of the colony, and in a sense responsible
for its safety; that the measures he adopted
were purely in self-defense, and that in no other way
could he possibly have saved the colonies from massacre.
Captain Standish took back with him the head
of Wituwamat, which was placed upon the fort as a
warning to all hostile Indians. This measure has
been severely censured. But it is replied that the
savages, whose bloodthirsty desires were fully roused,
could be influenced by deeds only, and not by words;
that no people should be blamed for not being in advance
of the age in which they lived, and that more
than a century after this, in the year 1747, in refined
and Christian England, the heads of the lords, who
were implicated in the Scots rebellion, were exposed
upon Temple Bar, the most frequented avenue between
London and Westminster. Judge Davis, in his New
England’s Memorial, commenting upon Mr. Robinson’s
letter, writes:</p>

<p>“These sentiments are honorable to Mr. Robinson.
They indicate a generous philanthropy, which
must always gain our affection, and should ever be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
cherished. Still the transactions, to which the strictures
relate, are defensible. As to Standish, Belknap
places his defense on the rules of duty imposed by his
character as the military servant of the colony. The
government, it is presumed, will be considered as acting
under severe necessity, and will require no apology
if the reality of the conspiracy be admitted, of which
there can be but little doubt. It is certain that they
were fully persuaded of its existence; and with the
terrible example of the Virginia massacre in fresh remembrance,
they had solemn duties to discharge.
The existence of the whole settlement was at hazard.”</p>

<p>As we have mentioned, the unintelligent Indians
often behaved like children. This energetic action
seemed to overwhelm all those tribes with terror, who
were contemplating a coalition with the Massachusetts
Indians against the English. They acted as if
bereft of reason, forsaking their houses, fleeing to the
swamps, and running to and fro in the most distracted
manner. Many consequently perished of hunger, and
of the diseases which exposure brought on. The
planting season had just come. In their fright they
neglected to plant; and thus, in the autumn, from
want of their customary harvest of corn, many more
perished.</p>

<p>Tyanough, who, the reader will recollect, was sachem
of the tribe at Mattakiest, the country between Barnstable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
and Yarmouth harbors, had been drawn into
the conspiracy. He sent four men, in a boat, to the
Governor, at Plymouth, with a present, hoping to appease
his anger. The boat was cast away. Three
were drowned. The one survivor went back, not
daring to show himself at Plymouth. The Indians
regarded the disaster as evidence of the anger of the
Englishman’s God.</p>

<p>The month of April 1623 had arrived. It was
necessary immediately to prepare the ground for
planting. The Pilgrims had but a scanty supply of
corn reserved for seed. Scarcely a kernel could be
spared for food. Until now necessity had compelled
the Pilgrims to act in partnership, having a common
store of corn to be equally distributed, the fields being
cultivated in common. It was now deemed best
that each man should have his own lot, to possess
whatever amount his industry might raise. As the
wants of the Colony rendered it necessary that some
should devote all their time to fishing, and there were
certain other public employments which would engross
the time of individuals, a small tax, in corn, was
imposed, to defray these public expenses.</p>

<p>About the middle of April they began to plant,
the weather being very favorable. Each man took
about an acre of land. Without ploughs, or the aid
of cattle, this was all one man could cultivate. Immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
the advantages of individual property, instead
of having a community of interest, was manifest.
All the boys and youth were ranged under
some family. This created a new scene of active industry.
Much more corn was planted, it is said, than
would have been otherwise. Even the women went
willingly into the field to aid in planting, taking their
little ones with them. The situation of the colonists,
at this time, seems to have been deplorable. Governor
Bradford writes:</p>

<p>“By the time our corn is planted our victuals are
spent; not knowing, at night, where to have a bit in
the morning, and have neither bread nor corn for
three or four months together, yet bear our wants
with cheerfulness. Having but one boat left, we divide
the men into several companies, six or seven in
each, who take their turns to go out with a net and
fish, and return not till they get some, though they be
five or six days out, knowing there is nothing at home,
and to return empty would be a great discouragement.
When they stay long, or get but little, the
rest go a digging shell fish. And thus we live in the
summer, only sending one or two to range the woods
for deer. They now and then get one, which we divide
among the company. In the winter we are helped
with fowl and ground nuts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>The friends in England sent a supply ship, the
Paragon, to the suffering colony. Three months
passed, and no tidings were received of her. But
fragments of wreck were picked up, which indicated
her fate. It afterwards appeared that, having reached
six hundred miles from land, she encountered a terrible
gale, by which she was so much disabled as to
be compelled to put back. Again she set sail, and
again put back, with all her upper works carried
by the board. A disastrous drouth, of six weeks
continuance also ensued, which threatened the utter
destruction of their corn crop. Inevitable starvation
seemed to stare them in the face. Mr. Winslow
writes:</p>

<p>“The most courageous were now discouraged, because
God, who had hitherto been our only shield
and supporter, now seemed, in his anger, to arm himself
against us. And who can withstand the fierceness
of his wrath?”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>In this extremity a day of fasting and prayer was
appointed. It was the middle of July. The morning
was cloudless, without a sign of rain. The sky
was as brass, scarce a green herb was to be seen,
and the earth was as ashes. The exercises of devotion
continued for eight hours. All felt alike that
there was no help but in God. Elder Brewster,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
an Israelite indeed, in whom there was no guile,
preached. Mr. Winslow writes:</p>

<p>“The exercises, on this special occasion, as of life
and death, being continued eight hours or more, ere
their close the clouds gathered, the heavens were
overcast, and before the next morning passed, gentle
showers were distilling upon the earth, and so it continued
some fourteen days, with seasonable weather
intervening. It were hard to say whether our withered
corn or drooping affections were most quickened
and revived, such was the bounty and goodness of
our God.”</p>

<p>Unexpectedly the withered corn thrust out green
leaves and gave promise of a joyful harvest. Even the
Indians were impressed with this evidence of divine
interposition. Hobbomak said feelingly:</p>

<p>“Now I see that the Englishman’s God is a good
God, for he hath heard you and sent you rain, and
without storms, tempest or thunder beating down
your corn. Surely your God is a good God.”</p>

<p>In the mean time, Captain Standish was sent out,
with the shallop, and a few men, to explore the coast
and purchase all the corn he could of the Indians.
Valiant as he was in fight, he was, in ordinary life, a
mild and gentle man, and eminently just in all his
dealings. Much as the Indians dreaded his avenging
arm, they seemed to be fully conscious that he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
do them no wrong. Early in August he returned
from this trading-voyage, with his shallop well loaded
down with corn, which proved invaluable to the Pilgrims
until their own harvest should come in.</p>

<p>He brought back with him Mr. David Thompson,
a Scotchman, who, with a small party of emigrants,
had commenced a plantation at the mouth of the Piscataqua,
where Portsmouth now stands. For these
many tokens of the divine goodness, Governor Bradford
appointed another day of thanksgiving. It may
be instructive here to insert Governor Bradford’s testimony
respecting the effect of a community of goods,
which experiment was so fairly tried, and under such
favorable circumstances, at Plymouth:</p>

<p>“The experience which was had in this common
course and condition,” he writes, “tried sundry years,
and that amongst godly and sober men, may well
evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato and other
ancients, and applauded by some of later times,—that
the taking away of property, and bringing a community
into a commonwealth would make them happy
and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God.
For this community, so far as it was such, was found
to breed much confusion and discontent, and to retard
much employment which would have been to
their benefit and comfort. For the young men, who
were the most able and fit for labor and service, did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
repine that they should spend their time and strength
to work for other men’s wives and children, without
any recompense.</p>

<p>“The strong, or man of parts, had no more in the
division of victuals and clothes, than he that was weak
and not able to do a quarter the other could. This
was thought injustice. The aged and graver men to
be ranked and equalized in labors, victuals, clothes,
etc., with the meaner and younger sort, thought it
some indignity and disrespect unto them. As for
men’s wives to be commanded to do service for other
men, as dressing their meat, washing their clothes,
etc., they deemed it a kind of slavery, neither could
many husbands well brook it. Let none object, this
is men’s corruption, and nothing against the course
itself. I answer, seeing all men have this corruption
in them, God, in his wisdom, saw another course fitter
for them.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Early in August two ships arrived, the Anne and
the Little James. The latter was a small vessel of
about forty-four tons, which was built for the company
and was to remain at Plymouth. The two vessels
brought sixty passengers. Some of them were very
worthy people and constituted a valuable addition to
the colony. Others were such sad miscreants that
the Pilgrims instructed by the disasters which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
Weymouth colonists had caused, refused to receive
them into their colony. The thriftless creatures, unable
to establish a settlement of their own, were compelled
to return to England.</p>

<p>The corn harvest was not yet ripe, and the newcomers
were greatly surprised at the destitution in
which they found the colonists. “The best dish,”
writes Bradford, “they could present them with, was
a lobster or a piece of fish, without bread or anything
else but a cup of fair spring water.” The new-comers
were afraid that the hungry colonists would eat
up all the provisions they had brought with them. On
the other hand the colonists were fearful that the new-comers
would devour their harvest of corn, which
was scarcely sufficient for so large an addition to their
numbers. They therefore decided that each of the
parties should rely upon its own resources.</p>

<p>On the 10th of September the Anne returned to
England, laden with clapboards and furs. Mr. Winslow
also sailed in her, on business for the colony.
The harvest was now in, and there was comparative
plenty. Many had raised more corn than their own
families would consume, and thus they had a supply
to sell to others. About the middle of this month
Captain Robert Georges arrived in Massachusetts
Bay with a number of families, to commence a new
plantation there. His grant of land was very indefinite.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
It embraced all the land lying on the northeast
side of Massachusetts Bay, together with all the
shores and coasts, for ten English miles, in a straight
line towards the northeast, and thirty miles into the
main land. He selected for his settlement, the spot
at Weymouth which had been abandoned by the Weston
Colony. Governor Georges visited Governor
Bradford, where he met with a very kind reception.</p>

<p>Some of the seamen, carousing in one of the
houses, built a great fire on a cold and windy night,
which was communicated to the thatch, and four
houses were burnt down. The store-house was greatly
endangered. Its loss would have been irreparable.
The Little James went on a cruise to the coast
of Maine, and there, in a violent storm, was wrecked.
Mid-winter now frowned around the Pilgrims as they
entered upon a new year, the year 1624.</p>

<p>Mr. Winslow returned from England, bringing
with him two heifers and a bull, an invaluable acquisition
to the colonists, being the first cattle that were
brought over. As they had no money, corn had become
the circulating medium. With the opening
spring all hands set to work to raise as much corn as
possible. This led to a petition to the Governor to
have a portion of land assigned, in perpetuity, to each
individual. When assigned yearly, by lot, that field
which one man, by skill and industry, had brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
into a good state of cultivation, was often taken from
him, and he received, perhaps, instead, a field neglected
and overrun with weeds. The request was
manifestly so reasonable, that one acre was given to
every man, as near the village as might be, to be held
seven years. It was deemed necessary, for safety
against the Indians, to keep as close together as possible.</p>

<p>With some internal disorders, the affairs of the
colony went on prosperously during the year, nothing
occurring to call the energies of Captain Standish
into requisition. The colony numbered one hundred
and eighty souls. They had some cattle and goats,
quite a number of swine, and numerous poultry.
Thirty-two dwelling houses were now occupied. The
palisades which surrounded the village were half a
mile in extent. A well-built fort stood upon Burial
Hill.</p>

<p>Mr. Winslow made a trading-voyage eastward one
hundred and fifty miles, in an open boat, “up a river
called the Kennebec.” He brought home seven hundred
pounds of beaver and other furs, having exchanged
corn for them. It was mid-winter, and they
encountered much tempestuous weather. The boat
was built by their ship carpenter, and had a small
deck over her midships to keep the corn dry. But
the men were exposed, unsheltered to winter on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
coast of Maine. These furs were purchased of the
natives, at a small price, and were sold in London at
a great profit.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims wished to hire money with which to
purchase in England the commodities which the Indians
greatly prized, and which they could exchange
with them for furs. Captain Standish was sent to
England to adjust certain difficulties which had arisen
between the colonists and their partners in London,
and also to hire money with which to purchase goods to
trade with the Indians. But the Captain arrived in London
at a very unfortunate hour. The city was then desolated
by that awful plague which was sweeping thousands
into the grave. It would also appear that the
credit of the colony was far from good. With great difficulty
Captain Standish succeeded in raising seven
hundred and fifty dollars, for which he paid the enormous
interest of fifty per cent. The risk to the
lender was indeed great. The only chance the colonists
had to pay the debt, was mainly in sending
home furs. But the ships thus laden had to run the
gauntlet of the hostile fleets of France and Turkey,
with both of which powers England was then
at war.</p>

<p>Captain Standish expended the small sum he had
raised, in trading commodities. He also brought
back the mournful intelligence of the death of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Reverend Mr. Robinson, who died at Leyden the 1st
of March, 1625. There were so many vessels sent
from England to the coast of Maine, engaged in the
fishing business, that the colonists, in consequence of
the competition, relinquished the fisheries, and engaged
in trading and planting, both of which had now
become profitable. Immense numbers of fishes were,
however, taken at their very door, which were used
to enrich the fields.</p>

<p>The rapid brook of fresh water, which ran at the
south side of the town, took its rise in several lakes
in the land above. Early in May vast shoals of herring
darkened the waters as they ascended the brook
from the sea to deposit their spawn in the lakes.
The colonists constructed, at the mouth of this brook,
a sort of net, made of planks and trellis work, so
that at one tide they would often take twelve
thousand fishes. Three or four were deposited in
each hill of corn, which promoted a luxuriant growth.
This corn was eagerly purchased by the Indians, they
paying one pound of beaver skin for one bushel of
corn. Fishing vessels occasionally called and purchased
their corn at six shillings a bushel. Several
other colonies were also established, which needed
supplies. Thus days of prosperity dawned upon the
colony, which had so long struggled with adversity.
But little occurred during the year 1626 worthy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
especial notice. The coasting-trade was becoming
increasingly important. Governor Bradford writes:</p>

<p>“Finding they ran a great hazard to go so long
voyages in a small, open boat, especially in the winter
season, they began to think how they might get a
small pinnace. They had no ship carpenter among
them, neither knew how to get one at present. But
they having an ingenious man, who was a house carpenter,
who had also wrought with the ship carpenter
that was dead, when he built their boats, at their
request, he put forth himself to make a trial that way,
of his skill, and took one of the biggest of the shallops
and sawed her in the middle, and so lengthened
her some five or six feet, and strengthened her with
timbers, and so built her up and laid a deck on her,
and so made her a convenient and wholesome vessel,
very fit and comfortable for their use, which did them
service seven years. And thus passed the affairs of
this year.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The prospects of the colony had so far brightened
that Mr. Allerton, who had been sent to England
this year, succeeded in raising one thousand dollars
at thirty per cent interest. During the year 1625
Captain Wollaston, with thirty emigrants, commenced
a settlement at a place they named Mount Wollaston,
in the northerly part of Braintree, now Quincy, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
Massachusetts. Most of these emigrants were men
of low condition, the hired laborers of Wollaston.
He soon became discontented, and took a large portion
of his servants to Virginia, where he disposed of
their labor as best he could. He left a man by the
name of Fitcher to guide the labor of those who remained
until his return. In the mean time one
Thomas Morton, “a pettifogging attorney of Furnival’s
Inn, a man of low habits,” succeeded in persuading
those who were left to renounce the authority of
Fitcher, and to live on terms of perfect equality and
freedom, without any laws whatever. He arranged a
great feast, and induced the men, in the frenzy of
intoxication, to drive Fitcher from the settlement.
They then entered upon an astonishing course of rioting
and drunkenness. They prosecuted vigorously
a trade with the natives, which was forbidden by royal
charter, of muskets, powder and bullets. This trade
was very profitable. The Indians, eager to obtain
muskets, would pay almost any sum for them. Morton
taught them how to use the guns, and employed
them to hunt, purchasing their furs.</p>

<p>Thus they rioted in abundance, and disgraced
themselves with the most shameless indulgence in
profanity and profligacy. They erected a May-pole,
and danced around it with the Indian women. In
accordance with these scenes of revelry, they changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
the name of the place to Merry Mount. Morton was
an Atheist: teaching that this was the only life; that
there was no responsibility to God, and that it was
the part of wisdom to indulge freely in all one’s desires.</p>

<p>This state of things created great alarm, in all the
various settlements, which had by this time been
established. The Indians, if once supplied with
European weapons of war, could easily, by combining,
destroy all the colonies. Governor Bradford
complains very bitterly of the peril. The Indians had
muskets in abundance; they were taught how to repair
their muskets when injured; they were furnished
with moulds for running bullets of various sizes.</p>

<p>“Yea,” writes Governor Bradford, “some have
seen them have their screw-plates to make screw-pins
themselves, when they want them, with sundry
other implements, wherewith they are ordinarily better
fitted and furnished than the English themselves.
It is well known that they will have powder and shot
when the English want it, and cannot get it; and yet
in a time of war or danger, as experience hath manifested,
when lead hath been scarce, and men for their
own defense would gladly have given four pence
a pound, which is dear enough, yet hath it been
bought up and sent to other places, and sold to such
as trade it with the Indians at twelve pence a pound.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
And it is likely the Indians give three or four shillings
the pound, for they will have it at any rate.</p>

<p>“And these things have been done in the same
times when some of their neighbors and friends are
daily killed by the Indians, or are in danger thereof,
and live but at the Indians’ mercy. Yea, some have
told them how gunpowder is made, and all the materials
in it, and that they are to be had in their own
land; and I am confident that could they attain to
make saltpetre they would teach them to make powder.
Oh the horribleness of this villainy! How many,
both Dutch and English, have been lately slain by
those Indians thus furnished! And no remedy provided,
nay the evil more increased, and the blood of
their brethren sold for gain; and in what danger all
these colonies are is too well known.</p>

<p>“Oh! that princes and parliaments would take
some timely order to prevent this mischief and, at
length to suppress it, by some exemplary punishment
upon some of those gain-thirsty murderers, for they
deserve no better title, before their colonies in these
parts be overthrown by these barbarous savages, thus
armed with their own weapons, by these evil instruments
and traitors to their neighbors and country.</p>

<p>“But I have forgotten myself, and have been too
long in this digression; but now to return. This
Morton having thus taught them the use of muskets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
he sold them all he could spare; and he and his consorts
determined to send for many out of England,
and had, by some of the ships, sent for above a score.
The which being known, and his neighbors meeting
the Indians in the woods, armed with guns in this
sort, it was a terror unto them who lived strugglingly
and were of no strength in any place. And other
places, though more remote, saw that this mischief
would quickly spread over all if not prevented. Besides,
they saw they should keep no servants, for Morton
would entertain any, how vile soever, and all the
scum of the country, or any discontents would flock
to him from all places, if this nest was not broken;
and they would stand in more fear of their lives and
goods, in a short time, from this wicked and debauched
crew, than from the savages themselves.”</p>

<p>The leading men of several settlements met together
to deliberate upon what measures to adopt in
this emergence. The Plymouth colony was stronger
than all the rest united.</p>

<p>The delegates came from Plymouth, from the
trading-house at the Kennebec, from the small settlement
at Salem, from Weymouth, and from several
other places where infant settlements had been commenced.
They decided to write a joint and friendly
letter to Morton, informing him of the danger to which
he was exposing all the English, and entreating him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
out of regard to the common safety, to change his
course. A messenger was sent with this letter, and
to bring back an answer. Morton replied insultingly
and defiantly, saying that they were meddling with
that which they had no concern; that he should continue
trade with the Indians just as he pleased, selling
them muskets, powder and shot, without asking any
one’s advice. The answer throughout was couched
in the most insulting terms.</p>

<p>Again, with the most singular moderation, a messenger
was sent to him with another friendly letter,
saying that they were consulting, not for selfish interests,
but for the good of all alike; that the lives of all
were endangered, and that the King’s proclamation
had forbidden the sale of fire-arms to the savages.
Another insolent answer was returned. He assured
them that he cared neither for the King’s proclamation
nor for them; and that if they thought they could
coerce him, they might come on as soon as they
pleased; he was ready for them.</p>

<p>It was now manifestly time to summon the energies
of Captain Standish to the rescue. He was exactly
the man for the occasion. With a small body
of armed men, eight in number, as valiant as himself,
Captain Standish set out for Merry Mount. In some
way, Morton had heard of his approach. With his
desperate men he had barricaded himself in a strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
log house, with an ample supply of powder and balls.
They well knew the reputation of the foe they were
to encounter, and in order to stimulate their waning
courage, had all become drunk. From their fortress,
which they deemed impregnable, they shouted their
scurrilous defiance to the Captain and his little band.
There are men with whom apparently the most reckless
bravery is combined with prudence and sound
judgment; who seem to be endowed with a sort of
instinct which teaches them when an act of seeming
desperation may be demanded by wisdom. Captain
Standish was such a man.</p>

<p>He was making arrangements to carry the house,
perhaps by approaching it from some unguarded
point, and setting it on fire, when Morton, drunk as
he was, saw his danger. Selecting a few of his men,
he emerged from his fortress, with the intention of
making a sudden and simultaneous rush upon Captain
Standish, and shooting him. Morton himself was so
intoxicated that, as afterwards found, his carbine was
overloaded, being nearly half filled with powder and
shot.</p>

<p>The captain, though of short stature, possessed
dignity of character and authority of bearing which
often overawed his foes. Without a moment’s hesitation,
he advanced with stately tread upon Morton,
totally regardless of his weapon, seized him by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
collar, wrenched the gun from his hands, and delivered
him over to his men, a humiliated and helpless captive.
The rest of the drunken crew, deprived of their
leader, were deemed powerless. The culprit was
taken to Plymouth, and was sent to England by the
first vessel that sailed, there to be tried for his crimes.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims, at Plymouth, had for some time
been in the habit of sending yearly to the fishing-grounds
off Cape Ann for a supply of cod. They
had erected quite a commodious stage upon the
cape, where they dressed and dried their fish. Some
London adventurers fitted out a fishing vessel for the
cape, and arriving there before the Plymouth people,
took possession of their stage, which they refused to
surrender when the Pilgrims came and demanded
their own.</p>

<p>The code militaire was, at this time, the rule of
life with Captain Standish. He would do no wrong;
and he would submit to no wrong. He was immediately
sent to Cape Ann to adjust the difficulty. There
was no room for question about the right and wrong
in the case. The new-comers had stolen the property
of the Pilgrims. Captain Standish peremptorily demanded
its restoration. The thieves barricaded themselves
on the stage. Captain Standish prepared for
battle, and would doubtless have recovered the stage
by force. “But Mr. Conant,” writes Baylies, “who dwelt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
there, and who was a man of a mild and conciliatory disposition,
and Captain Pierce, a fast friend of the Plymouth
people, also happening to be there with his
ship, interposing their good offices, the dispute was
compromised, the ship’s crew having promised to
build another stage.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>Emigration to the New World was now rapidly
increasing. Many new settlements sprang up and
many worthless characters came over, lured by the
love of adventure. Not a few of these came to the
flourishing Plymouth colony. This led to a new organization
of the colony, the details of which it is not
necessary to enter into here. The company in London,
who had obtained the charter from the King and
held the territory, sold out their whole property to the
colonists, for nine thousand dollars, to be paid in nine
annual instalments of one thousand dollars. The
general features of this important change is thus given
by Baylies.</p>

<p>“Every head of a family, and every prudent young
man who was of age, both of the first and later comers,
were admitted into a general partnership; and all
agreed that the trade should be managed as usual,
devoting all its profits to the payment of the debt;
that every single freeman should have a single share,
and that every father of a family should have leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
to purchase a share for himself, another for his wife,
and one for each of his children who lived with him,
and that every one should pay his share of the debts,
according to his number of shares. One cow and
two goats were divided by lot to every six shares, and
the swine in proportion. And to every share, in addition
to the acre lots, which they already held, and the
gardens and homestead of which they were possessed,
twenty acres of tillage land was assigned by lot,
which were to be five acres broad on the water and
four acres deep.”</p>

<p>The meadow lands, for mowing, being quite small
in extent, were held in common, mowing places
being assigned, as the seasons came around, to all
the families, according to their number of cattle. As
the Pilgrims were living in constant apprehension of
a combination of the Indians against them, it was
deemed important that they should not be widely
scattered in their fields of labor. A sudden attack
might expose them to destruction, unless they could
be speedily rallied. Twenty acres of land was much
more than any one man could cultivate with the agricultural
facilities then at their control. It was therefore
agreed, before any lots were cast, that those
whose lots should fall next to the town, should take a
neighbor or two, whom they best liked, to plant corn
with them for four years. By that time it was supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
the colony would be out of danger from any
hostile attack. This arrangement gave general satisfaction,
and inspired the colonists with new energies.</p>

<p>An incident occurred at this time, quite interesting,
as illustrative of the adventurous life upon which
these men had entered, in the wilderness of this New
World; a life of excitement and heroic achievements,
with its full share of earthly joys as well as
griefs.</p>

<p>A ship, laden with passengers and goods, left
England for Virginia. The captain was taken sick,
so that he could not leave his cabin. The inefficient
mate became bewildered. After six weeks at sea
their provisions were exhausted. Starvation stared
them in the face. Knowing not where they were, in
the night, and in a gale of wind, they were almost
miraculously swept over the shoals of Cape Cod, and
striking a sand bar, were driven over it into a little
bay, then called Manamoyake, now Chatham. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
vessel leaking badly, with many of her planks sprung,
was forced high upon the beach, so that, with the receding
tide, not only the crew safely landed, and the
cargo, though much damaged with salt water, was
taken on shore.</p>

<p>The shipwrecked people, rejoicing to have escaped
with their lives, reared their huts upon the shore, not
knowing where they were or what would become of
them. While in this state of suspense and sadness,
they were alarmed one morning in seeing several
birch canoes coming around a headland filled with
Indians. They seized their guns and stood upon defense.
But the Indians paddled rapidly along as if
apprehending no harm, and addressing them in English,
inquired if they were the Governor of Plymouth’s
people, or his friends. The Indians told
them where they were, offered to conduct them to
Plymouth, or to take letters for them. The Englishmen
were greatly comforted by this intelligence.
They gave the Indians several valuable presents from
their shipwrecked stores, and despatched, under their
guidance, two men, with a letter to Governor Bradford,
entreating him to send a boat to them with
spikes, oakum, pitch and sundry other materials, with
which they hoped to repair their vessel, and again to
get her afloat from her soft bed in the sand.</p>

<p>The Governor immediately loaded a large boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
with the needful articles, including a generous supply
of corn, and taking also trading commodities with
which to buy additional supplies of the Indians, went
himself to the aid of his unfortunate countrymen. It
was winter, when the chill sea was swept by angry
storms. It was not safe, at that season, in the boat,
to attempt to sail around the head of the cape, and to
brave the storms of the Atlantic on the eastern shore.
He therefore sailed across the bay in a southeasterly
direction, and entering Barnstable Bay, ascended a
little creek called Namskeket, which ran inland nearly
a mile. From the head of this creek it was but two
miles across the cape to Manamoyake Bay, where the
vessel was stranded.</p>

<p>The Indians, accustomed to portages, were readily
hired to transport the articles across the land.
The shoulders of the Indian women would bear very
heavy burdens. The arrival of the Governor with
the abundant supplies caused great rejoicing. He
spent a few days with them, and then, returning to
his boat, sailed along the inner coast till he had purchased
of the natives a full cargo of corn, with which
he replenished the granaries at Plymouth.</p>

<p>The stranded vessel was repaired and floated,
when another fierce tempest arose, and she was
driven, a hopeless wreck, upon the shore. The beach
in Chatham, where she was stranded, is still called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
the “Old Ship.” Remains of the wreck were visible
within the present century.</p>

<p>Some of these shipwrecked emigrants were men
of wealth, bringing with them many servants to cultivate
large estates in Virginia. But the majority were
men in the humble walks of life. Application was
immediately made to Governor Bradford that they all
might be permitted to repair to Plymouth, and to remain
there until they should have the means to convey
themselves to Virginia. The humane Pilgrims,
ever ready to do a kind deed, without hesitancy acceded
to their request. Boats were sent up the
Namskeket Creek, and with great labor the shipwrecked
emigrants and their goods were transported
to the Christian colony.</p>

<p>“After they were hither come,” writes the Governor,
“and something settled, the masters desired
some ground to employ their servants upon, seeing it
was like to be the latter end of the year before they
could have passage for Virginia, and they had now
the winter before them; they might clear some ground
and plant a crop, to help bear their charge, and keep
their servants in employment. And if they had opportunities
to depart before the same was ripe, they
would sell it on the ground. So they had ground
appointed them in convenient places.”</p>

<p>Among these emigrants there were many irreligious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
and disorderly men. Some were men of high
character, who were highly appreciated by the Pilgrims.
But there was general rejoicing in the little
colony at the end of the summer, when two vessels
arrived from England, and conveyed them to their
original destination in Virginia.</p>

<p>It was now decided to build a pinnace, on the
southern coast of the Cape, so that they could easily
run along the shore there, in both directions, engaging
in trade with the Indians. About twenty miles
south of Plymouth, upon the shore of Buzzard’s Bay,
in the present town of Sandwich, there was a small
harbor called Manomet, which the Pilgrims had not
unfrequently visited. Sailing down from Plymouth
on the north side, they could approach this spot
within about four or five miles. Thus all the furs and
corn which they could purchase on the south and
eastern shores of the cape, could be sent across this
“carrying place,” and thence could be conveyed to
Plymouth, avoiding the dangerous navigation around
the cape. A boat-house was built here, and also a
dwelling-house, where a few agents were stationed, to
navigate the boat and to engage in agriculture. The
enterprise proved eminently successful.</p>

<p>Again the company sent Mr. Allerton to England
with a cargo of furs, to meet their engagements there,
and to obtain authority to establish a trading-post on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
the Kennebec River. The Dutch were establishing
trading-posts and agricultural colonies near the mouth
of the Hudson, and many friendly messages and courteous
acts were interchanged between these two
parties. There were many English refugees in Leyden
who, upon the death of their pastor, Mr. Robinson,
were anxious to join their friends in America.
They had expressed this desire very earnestly; but
they were poor. They were unable to provide themselves
with an outfit, or even to pay for their passage
across the Atlantic. In order to aid these exiled and
impoverished brethren, Governor Bradford, Captain
Standish, and several others, formed a company and
purchased of the Plymouth colony all their right to
trade with the Indians for six years. For this they
paid twelve thousand dollars. The main object of the
purchasers seemed to be to raise money enough to
bring over their friends from Holland. There were
eight of the Pilgrim fathers united with four gentlemen
in London who assumed these responsibilities.
Very truly Mr. Baylies writes:</p>

<p>“The generosity of the chiefs of the colony to
their Leyden brethren is unparalleled. They almost
deprived themselves of the common necessaries of life
to get them over, and to support them until they were
able to support themselves; laboring at the same time
under heavy debts, for which they paid exorbitant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
interest. But their necessities seemed only to stimulate
them to greater exertions.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>This new company, having obtained a patent for
a trading-post on the Kennebec River, erected a
house in a place called Cushenoe, now the city of
Augusta. Here they collected, for purposes of trade,
a large supply of coats, shirts, rags, blankets, biscuit,
pease, etc. In the month of August, 1629, thirty-five
families arrived at Plymouth from Leyden. Nine
months after, in May, 1630, another ship arrived,
bringing several more families. The new company,
of which the Governor and the captain were the principal
men, paid all their expenses, though they
amounted to two thousand seven hundred dollars.
Houses were assigned to them; grounds were purchased
for them, and they were fed from the public
stores for more than a year. When we remember
that there was no blood relationship between these
parties, no partnership, no bond of union excepting
Christian charity; that the benefactors were poor,
struggling for their own support, and that many of
those whom they were thus aiding they had never
seen before, we must regard this act as one of extraordinary
generosity.</p>

<p>A trading-post had been established on the Penobscot
River, at a point called Bagaduce, now Castine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Here a very lucrative trade was transacted
with the Indians, mainly in furs. The French claimed
this post as within their domain. A small French
vessel entered the bay, and finding the post defenceless,
rifled it of all its contents, and carried off three
hundred pounds of beaver skins and other property
to the value of over two thousand dollars. Governor
Bradford, in his description of this annoying event,
writes:</p>

<p>“It was in this manner: The master of the house,
and part of the company with him, were come with
their vessel to the westward to fetch a supply of goods
which was brought over for them. In the mean time
comes a small French ship into the harbor; and
amongst the company was a false Scot. They pretended
that they were newly come from the sea, and
knew not where they were, and that their vessel was
very leaky, and desired that they might haul her
ashore and stop her leaks. And many French compliments
they used and conges they made. And in
the end, seeing but three or four simple men, that
were servants, and by this Scotchman understanding
that the master and the rest of the company were
gone from home, they fell of commending their guns
and muskets that lay upon racks by the wall-side.
They took them down to look on them, asking if they
were charged. And when they were possessed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
them, one presents a piece, ready charged, against
the servants, and another a pistol, and bid them not
stir, but quietly deliver up their goods. They carried
some of the men aboard, and made the others help
to carry away the goods. And when they had taken
what they pleased, they set them at liberty and went
their way with this mockery, bidding them tell their
master when he came, that some of the Isle of Rye
gentlemen had been there.”</p>

<p>The emigration from England rapidly increased
and, ere long, the colony numbered fifteen hundred
souls. In the year 1628, John Endicot, with a party
of emigrants, established rather a feeble settlement
at Salem, then called Naumkeag. On the 30th of
May, 1630, another party commenced a colony at Dorchester,
then called Mattapan. In the months of
June and July of the same year, a fleet of eleven vessels
arrived from England, bringing over a large number
of passengers, and, after some deliberation, they
selected what is now Charlestown for their principal
settlement. A part of the company went to Watertown.
About fifteen hundred came over during the
year.</p>

<p>The Puritans in England were now gaining the
ascendency. Men of influence and rank were joining
them. They were not at all disposed to bow the
knee to those who had heretofore been their persecutors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
The eminent John Winthrop came as Governor
of the powerful Massachusetts colony, which colony
was stronger in numbers, and far stronger in wealth
and influence, when it first landed, than was the Plymouth
Colony after long years of struggle with the
hardships of the wilderness. Governor Winthrop
was a gentleman of culture, position and wealth.
Two of the emigrants, Humphry and Johnson, had
married sisters of the Earl of Lincoln. Sir Richard
Saltonstall, who was one of their number, was son
of the Lord Mayor of London. There were many
others, men of family and fortune, who, having lived
in the enjoyments of large estates, were accustomed
to all the refinements of polished society. Others,
such as Hampden, Cromwell and Pym, who subsequently
became conspicuous in the overthrow of the
tyrannic throne of Charles I, wished to join them,
but were prevented by a royal edict.</p>

<p>As early as 1623 there were as many as fifty vessels
engaged in fishing on the New England coast.
Several of these were owned by parties in Dorchester,
England. They sent a party of fourteen persons
to a spot near Cape Ann, where Gloucester now
stands, to commence a small settlement. It was their
main object to provide a home upon the land, to which
the sailors might resort for refreshment and rest, and
where they might be brought under religious influences.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
The site was purchased of the Plymouth
colony. They carried out live stock, and erected a
house, with a stage to dry fish, and with vats for the
manufacture of salt. The experiment proved an utter
failure, from the incompetence of the colonists.</p>

<p>The New World, as affording facilities for promising
homes, was attracting ever increasing attention.
This led to the organization of a powerful company,
who obtained a grant of lands extending from the
Atlantic to the Western Ocean, and in width, running
from three miles north of the Merrimac river to
a line three miles south of the Charles. The company
invested with this immense territory consisted
of a number of private individuals, who, by their
charter, became invested with almost imperial powers.
The Plymouth colonists recognized the superior
numbers, opulence and rank of their Massachusetts
brethren, and were ever ready to render to them
the precedence. And though the Massachusetts
colonists were occasionally somewhat arrogant, as if
fully conscious of their superiority, they were generally
just, and at times even generous, to those brethren
who were in entire accord with them in religious
faith, and whose virtues they could not but revere.</p>

<p>The advent of these colonists was a great blessing
to the Indians. The men of Plymouth and of Massachusetts,
alike recognizing that universal brotherhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
which Christianity so prominently enforces, were
disposed to treat the Indians with the utmost kindness,
and to do everything in their power to elevate
and bless them. They purchased their lands, their
corn and their furs, and paid fair prices for them, thus
introducing into their wigwams comforts of which they
previously had no conception. The Indians were
thus stimulated to industry, and these friendly relations
would have continued, to the inestimable benefit
of both parties, but for the outrages inflicted upon the
savages by such godless wretches as the infamous
Captain Hunt, the low and thieving gang of Weymouth
adventurers, and drunken sailors and reckless
vagabonds, who, fleeing from crimes in their own
country, gave loose to unrestrained passions in this
New World.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims had no power to prevent these atrocities.
The poor savages, ignorant and degraded,
knew not how to discriminate. If drunken white
men, vagabond sailors from some English vessel, pilfered
their wigwams, insulting their wives and daughters,
there was no law to which they could appeal,
and, in their benighted state, the only redress before
them was to violate, with still more terrible atrocities,
with torture and flame and blood, the inmates of some
white man’s log house, the home, perhaps, of piety
and prayer, where the Indian, if hungry, would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
fed, if sick, would be nursed with true brotherly and
sisterly tenderness. Thus, in God’s mysterious government
of this world, the consequences of the crimes
of the vilest men fell with awful desolation upon the
heads of the best of men.</p>

<p>The Indians had no circulating medium. Indeed
they had no trade among themselves. In illustration
of the benefits which the coming of the Pilgrim
Fathers conferred upon them, let us again refer to the
trading-post established, about twenty miles south
from Plymouth, at Manomet, now Sandwich. Here,
upon a small but navigable stream, a dwelling and
storehouses were erected, where canoes and coasting
vessels from all along the shore, as far as New Amsterdam,
at the mouth of the Hudson, could meet
in the exchange of their articles of value. A land
carriage of but about six miles, over the neck of the
Cape, the Suez of America, as it was then called,
brought them to the waters of Massachusetts Bay,
and to intercourse with all the settlements and Indian
villages scattered along its shores. Indian runners
could easily transport the light articles of traffic, and
thus the dangerous passage around the vast peninsula
of Cape Cod was avoided. Some circulating medium
seemed essential in the trade thus commenced and
rapidly extending.</p>

<p>The Narragansets and Pequots, residing upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Narraganset and Buzzard’s Bays, made, from the small
shells of a species of clam, a very beautiful ornamental
belt, called wampum. The shells, graceful in
form, beautifully colored and highly polished, were
strung like beads, by a hole drilled through the centre,
or were woven into rich embroidery. Three
purple shells or six white ones were considered equivalent
to an English penny. A string, two yards in
length, was valued at five shillings. The Dutch,
from New Amsterdam, sent cargoes to this trading-post.
Thus sugar, cloths of various texture, cutlery
and garden tools were obtained by the Indians.
Friendly relations existed, and the happiness thus
fostered might have continued uninterrupted but for
the wickedness of men who were strangers to the
principles which animated the Pilgrims.</p>

<p>A powerful Indian chief had his seat upon an adjoining
hill, at the foot of which a busy Indian village
was nestled. When the Dutch, at the mouth of the
Hudson, first heard of this post, they sent a small
trading-vessel to it, with very friendly letters to Governor
Bradford. They landed and marched up to the
trading-house, accompanied by a band of music. The
trumpet notes, reverberating through those wilds,
must have emptied the Indian village to gaze upon
the unwonted scene. The Dutch commander sent
an Indian runner to Governor Bradford, requesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
him to send a boat for him to the other side of the
bay, as he could not travel so far on foot through the
Indian trails. A boat was at once despatched to
what is now called Scussett, and the chief men of the
Dutch party were conveyed to Plymouth, where they
were received with the highest honors. They remained
several days with the Pilgrims, enjoying their
profuse hospitality, and were then sent back in the
boat. The friendly intercourse thus commenced, was
continued for several years uninterrupted. Governor
Bradford, speaking of the trade thus introduced, and
of its great advantage to the Indians, writes:</p>

<p>“But that which turned most to their profit, in
time, was an entrance into the trade of wampum.
Strange it was to see the great alteration it made in
a few years among the Indians themselves. For all
the Indians of these parts and the Massachusetts had
none or very little of it, excepting the chief and some
special persons, who wore a little of it for ornament.
It being only made and kept by the Pequots and Narragansets,
who grew rich and potent by it; whereas,
the rest, who use it not, are poor and beggarly.</p>

<p>“Neither did the English of this plantation, or
any other in the land, till now, that they had knowledge
of it from the Dutch, so much as know what it
was, much less that it was a commodity of that worth
and value. But after it grew thus to be a commodity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
in these parts, these Indians fell into it also, and to
learn how to make it. It hath now continued a current
commodity about this twenty years, and it may
prove a drug in time. In the mean time it makes the
Indians of these parts rich and powerful.”</p>

<p>Such were the humble beginnings of the commerce
of New England. The very spot upon which
this trading-house stood can now be pointed out.
“On it may the traveller pause and reflect how things
then were! how they now are! Now, on what sea,
to what coast of the habitable globe have not their
descendants carried the products of their soil and industry,
outstripping all other nations, with only England
as a rival.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>In the year 1630 the first public execution took
place. It will be remembered that one John Billington,
a man of worthless character, had, in some way,
smuggled himself into the company of the Pilgrims.
He had two boys, who seem to have been as worthless
as he himself. Governor Bradford had written
of him, “He is a knave, and so will live and die.”
He had already, in 1621, for vile abuse of Captain
Standish, been condemned to have his neck and heels
tied together. For some alleged injury or insult, he
waylaid and shot a young man by the name of John
Newcomen. The murderer had adopted the opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
that the colonists had no power granted them to inflict
capital punishment. He had a fair trial before a jury
of twelve men. There was no doubt whatever respecting
his guilt. The court had some doubt as to
its authority to inflict the penalty of death, since the
Council, from whom its authority was derived, had
no such power. The advice of Governor Winthrop
was sought, and that of the ablest men of the Massachusetts
colony. They advised, with perfect unanimity,
“that the murderer ought to die, and the land be
purged from blood.” He was accordingly executed
in October, 1630.</p>

<p>In the year 1631, a singular event occurred. A
very eccentric man, calling himself Sir Christopher
Gardner, visited Massachusetts. He was descended,
it is said, from the illustrious house of the Bishop of
Winchester, and in his extended travels had visited
nearly all quarters of the globe. At Jerusalem, he
had been made knight of the Holy Sepulchre. Weary,
as he said, of the world, and desiring to do penance,
by bodily mortification, for his sins, he came to the
Pilgrims, offering to perform the most menial services
for his living. Still he brought over with him two
servants, and a very fine-looking woman whom he
called his cousin. He endeavored to join the church,
but they would not receive him. Being guilty of conduct
for which he was about to be arrested and brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
to trial, he fled into the wilderness, and took refuge
with the Indians. The Massachusetts authorities
offered a reward for his capture and return to them.</p>

<p>Some of the Namasket Indians came to Governor
Bradford, from the vicinity of Middleborough, and
told him where Sir Christopher was, and that they
could easily kill him, but could not easily take him
alive; that he was a desperate man, and had a gun
and sword, and that he would certainly kill some of
them should they attempt to take him. The Governor
told them by no means to kill him, but to watch
their opportunity and to capture him. They did so,
and catching him one day by the side of a river, endeavored
to surround him. In his attempts to escape,
by getting into a canoe to cross the stream, as he
presented his musket to his pursuers, to keep them
off the frail structure of bark, swept by the current
against a rock, turned under him, and he was thrown,
with his musket, into the water. Dripping, he reached
the shore, his musket no longer of any use, and his
only resource the rapier. He brandished that so
fiercely that the Indians did not dare close in upon
him. They, however, got some long poles, and with
blows such as savages would be likely to strike, beat
the sword out of his hands, fearfully bruising and
mangling them.</p>

<p>He being thus disarmed and rendered helpless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
they seized him and conveyed him to Governor Bradford.
As the Governor looked upon the poor man,
with his arms and hands terribly inflamed and swollen,
the Indians said: “We did not hurt him; we only
whipped him a little with our sticks.” The Governor
censured the Indians for beating him so cruelly, and
had his wounds tenderly nursed. Some papers upon
his person showed that he was a concealed papist,
and one who had enjoyed the highest advantages of
university education. Governor Winthrop, being informed
of his apprehension, caused him to be brought
to Massachusetts, and then sent him immediately to
England.</p>

<p>This man sent in a petition, which two others
signed, to the British Government, condemning severely
both the colonies of Plymouth and Massachusetts,
stating that they intended rebellion; “that they
meant to be wholly separate from the church and
laws of England, and that their ministers and people
did continually rail against the state, the church and
the bishops.”</p>

<p>Sir Richard Saltonstall, and two other prominent
members of the Massachusetts colony, were then in
England. They were called before the Council to
answer the accusation. They did it in writing, and
so satisfactorily, as to draw from the Council a vote of
approbation instead of condemnation. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
also informed that, as freedom of religious worship was
one of the principal reasons of emigration to New
England, and that, as it was important to the government
to strengthen New England, it was not the intention
of his Majesty to impose the ceremonies of
the Church of England upon the colonists.</p>

<p>The first party of colonists for Massachusetts
embarked in six vessels. It consisted of three hundred
men, eighty women, married and single, and
twenty-six children, with an abundant outfit of food,
clothing, tools, and military weapons, and “a plentiful
provision of godly ministers.” Mr. Francis Higginson,
one of the most prominent of these emigrants,
soon after his arrival wrote home saying:</p>

<p>“When we first came to Naumkeag, we found
about half a score of houses, and a fair house newly
built for the Governor. We found also abundance of
corn planted by them, very good and well liking.
And we brought with us about two hundred passengers
and planters more, which, by common consent
of the old planters, were all combined together in one
body politic, under the same Governor. There are
in all of us, both old and new planters, about three
hundred, whereof two hundred of them are settled at
Naumkeag, now called Salem and the rest have
planted themselves at Massachusetts Bay, beginning
to build a town there which we do call Charlestown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
“But that which is our greatest comfort and
means of defense above all others is, that we have
here the true religion and holy ordinances of Almighty
God taught among us. Thanks be to God
we have here plenty of preaching and catechizing,
with strict and careful exercise and good and commendable
orders to bring our people into a Christian
conversation, with whom we have to do withal. And
thus we doubt not that God will be with us; and if
God be with us, who can be against us?”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>About that time an Episcopal clergyman, by the
name of William Blackstone, was the sole occupant
and proprietor of the peninsula of Boston, then called
Shawmut. The water at Charlestown was not good.
But there was a very fine supply of crystal water
gushing abundantly from a spring in Shawmut. Rev.
Mr. Blackstone, had left England because “he disliked
the power of the Lords-Bishops.” By his invitation
many were led to transfer their habitations
across the water, to the forest-covered peninsula,
and thus were laid the foundations of the renowned
capital of New England.</p>

<p>In the year 1632 Plymouth colony was in a state
of greater prosperity than ever before. Increasing
troubles in England and encouraging reports from
America gave new impetus to the spirit of emigration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
The products of agriculture were in greater
demand. Cattle of all kinds had much increased,
and brought high prices. More land was required
for cultivation. All the land in Plymouth was occupied,
and still new settlers were coming. Fears of
any attack on the part of the Indians had greatly
subsided. Enterprising men began to push into the
surrounding region, seeking choice localities and
larger farms.</p>

<p>Just across the bay of Plymouth, on the north,
there was a reach of land commanding a fine view
of the little settlement at Plymouth and of the
adjacent waters. Captain Standish selected for himself
a very attractive location there, including what is
still called “Captain’s Hill.” Here the descendants
of an ancestor so illustrious are now rearing a monument
to his memory.</p>

<p>The town was named Duxbury, in honor of the
captain, as that was the name of the seat which his
family occupied in England. Elder Brewster took a
farm by his side. Here both of these distinguished
men, warm friends, could often be seen in their solitary
fields, clearing away the forests, where no
sound of the axe had ever before been heard since
the creation of the world. These lands were deemed
among the best in the colony. Governor Bradford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
seems to have deplored the gradual dispersion of the
colonists. He wrote in terms of lamentation:</p>

<p>“Now as their stocks increased and their increase
was vendible, there was no longer holding them together.
They could not otherwise keep their cattle;
and having oxen grown they must have land for
ploughing and tillage. And no man now thought
he could live, except he had cattle and a great deal
of ground to keep them; all striving to increase their
stocks. By which means they were scattered all over
the bay, and the town, in which they lived compactly
till now, was left very thin, and, in a short time,
almost desolate. And if this had been all, it had
been less, though too much; but the church must
also be divided.</p>

<p>“Those that lived on their lots, on the other side
of the bay, called Duxbury, could not long bring their
wives and children to public worship and church
meetings here; but they sued to be dismissed and to
become a body of themselves. So they were dismissed,
though very unwillingly. To prevent any
further scattering from this place, it was thought best
to give out some good farms to special persons who
would promise to live at Plymouth, and who would be
likely to be helpful to the church or commonwealth,
and so to tie the lands to Plymouth as farms for the
same. There they might keep their cattle, and till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
the land by some servants, and retain their dwellings
here.</p>

<p>“And so some special lands were granted at a
place general, called Green’s Harbor, (Marshfield)
where no allotments had been in the former division;
a place very well meadowed and fit to keep and rear
cattle, in good store. But alas! this remedy proved
worse than the disease. For within a few years those
that had thus got footing tore themselves away, partly
by force, and partly by wearing out the rest with importunity
and pleas of necessity, so that they must
either suffer them to go, or live in continual opposition
and contention. This I fear will be the ruin of New
England, at least of the churches of God there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<span class="subhead"><i>The Courtship of Miles Standish.</i></span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Removal to Duxbury.—Intercourse with the Dutch.—Trading Posts
on the Connecticut.—Legend of the courtship of Miles Standish.—Personal
Appearance of the Captain.—Proposition to John
Alden.—His Anguish and Fidelity.—Interview with Priscilla.—The
Indian Alarm.—Departure of Captain Standish.—Report of
his Death.—The Wedding.</p></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding the removal of Captain Standish
across the bay, to his beautiful and fertile farm there,
he still took a very lively interest in everything relating
to the welfare of the colony, and of the little
village which he had been so instrumental in founding.
Mr. Bradford had for twelve successive years
been chosen Governor. He was anxious to be released
from the cares of office. In the annual election
of 1633, he importuned for release so earnestly that
the people yielded to his request, and chose Edward
Winslow as his successor. At the same time seven
assistants were chosen, of whom Captain Miles Standish
was the first.</p>

<p>The Dutch, from the mouth of the Hudson, had
explored the Connecticut river. The natives were
anxious to have a trading post established on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
beautiful stream, which was lined with Indian tribes.
They sent a delegation to Plymouth with this request.
The Pilgrims were not prepared to commence a settlement
there, but they sent a small vessel up the
river, and had great success in their traffic. The Indians
then applied to the Governor of the Massachusetts
colony. But he was not inclined to embark in
an enterprise so difficult, where the post could only be
reached by a long and perilous voyage around Cape
Cod, or by a journey of many days through a pathless
forest.</p>

<p>Some however of the private members of both
of these colonies foreseeing the danger that the Dutch
might anticipate them there, held a conference at
Boston with some of the prominent men of Plymouth,
and tried to form a partnership to engage in the undertaking.
They were however discouraged by the
representations which were made to them. It was
urged that the Indians were very numerous, that they
could bring many thousand warriors into the field,
that many of them were hostile, that the river was
difficult of access in consequence of a bar, and that
during seven months in the year it was closed by ice.
Thus influenced, they abandoned the enterprise.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Earl of Warwick had obtained
a patent of all the land, extending west, one
hundred and twenty miles from Narraganset Bay, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
the Dutch settlements at the mouth of the Hudson.
This included the whole of the present State of Connecticut.
The Dutch heard of this, and prepared to
anticipate the English, by making an immediate settlement
on the Connecticut River. This roused Governor
Winslow and ex-Governor Bradford, and they
determined immediately to commence a settlement in
that region. At the same time, they sent a courteous
message to Governor Winthrop, expressing the hope
that their brethren of Massachusetts would not be
displeased with their adventure, since the Massachusetts
colony had declined embarking in the enterprise.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Dutch had dispatched an
expedition, accompanied by quite an armed force,
which ascended the river and, disembarking where
Hartford now stands, erected a fort and commenced
a settlement. Two pieces of ordnance were placed
in position to sweep the river; and they loudly proclaimed
that they should not allow any of the English
to pass by.</p>

<p>The Plymouth colonists took a small vessel, which
could easily cross the bar at the mouth of the river,
and placed on board of it the frame of a house, with
all the materials for putting it together. The expedition
was commanded by Lieutenant Holmes. When
they arrived opposite Hartford, the Dutch, standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
by their guns with lighted matches, ordered them to
stop, threatening to shoot if they did not immediately
comply with the demand. But Holmes pushed boldly
by, and the Dutch commander did not venture to proceed
to those measures of violence, which would
surely have brought down upon the Dutch colonies
the vengeance of the British navy.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Holmes proceeded a short distance
farther up the river, to a place called Nattawanute,
now Windsor, where, near the mouth of a little stream,
he put up his house, which was both fort and dwelling,
surrounded it with palisades, and, unfurling the
British flag, was ready to bid defiance to all foes,
whether Dutch or Indians.</p>

<p>The Dutch commander at Hartford sent word to
the authorities at the mouth of the Hudson of what
had been done. Governor Van Twiller dispatched
an armed band of seventy men, with orders to tear
down the house at Windsor and drive away the occupants.
He supposed that this could easily be done
without any bloodshed, and thus without necessarily
introducing war. But the intrepid Holmes was ready
for battle against any odds. The leader of the Dutch
party saw that a fierce conflict must take place, and
one uncertain in its results. He therefore came to a
parley and finally retired. An immense quantity of
furs, beaver and otter skins, was this year sent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
England, which enabled the company to meet all its
obligations.</p>

<p>It would be hardly warrantable, in a Life of Captain
Miles Standish, to omit reference to a remarkable
legend with which his name has ever been associated,
though some have expressed the opinion that it was
not very clearly verified by authentic documents. A
literary gentleman who has investigated the subject
more thoroughly probably than any other person,
writes in reference to these doubts: “The anecdote is
in all the histories. Why should it not be true? I
am inclined to think it is; and am willing to back it
against most historic facts that are two hundred years
old.” The story, as it has drifted down to our times,
is in brief as follows. We give it as presented by
Mr. Longfellow, in his exquisite poem entitled “The
Courtship of Miles Standish.” It is very evident that
Mr. Longfellow had minutely studied our early colonial
history, as the reader will perceive that he is very
accurate in his historical allusions. The poem opens
with a description of Captain Standish, in his lonely
and humble log hut. His beautiful wife, Rose, was
one of the first who had died, and the place of her
burial, like that of others, was carefully concealed,
that the Indians might not perceive how the colony
had become weakened:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“In the old colonial days, in Plymouth, the land of the Pilgrims,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To and fro in a room of his simple and primitive dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad in doublet and hose and boots of Cordovan leather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strode with a martial air Miles Standish, the Puritan Captain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buried in thought he seemed, with his hands behind him, and pausing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever and anon to behold his glittering weapons of warfare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cutlass and corslet of steel, and his trusty sword of Damascus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curved at the point and inscribed with its mystical Arabic sentence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While underneath in a corner were fowling piece, musket and matchlock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short of stature he was, but strongly built and athletic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broad in the shoulders, deep chested, with muscles and sinews of iron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brown as a nut was his face, but his russet beard was already<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flaked with patches of snow, as hedges sometimes in November.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A very handsome young man, by the name of
John Alden, shared with Captain Standish the comforts
and discomforts of the widower’s home. He had
fair hair, azure eyes and a Saxon complexion, and was
sufficiently unlike the Captain for them to be very
warm friends. There could be no rivalry between
the gentle young man of books and romance, and the
stern veteran of facts and the sword. John Alden
was deeply in love with Priscilla, the most beautiful
maiden in Plymouth. Death had robbed her of both
father and mother, and she was equally in love with
John. But the bashful student had not yet summoned
courage to declare his love. But it so happened that
Captain Standish, without any knowledge of his
friend’s state of mind, had also turned his eyes to
Priscilla, as the successor of Rose. Conscious of his
own imperfections as a lady’s man, and fearful that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
could not woo the beautiful maiden in fitting phrase,
he applied to his scholarly friend to speak in his behalf.
In the following melodious strains the poet
gives utterance to the Captain’s speech:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“’Tis not good for man to be alone, say the scriptures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This I have said before, and again and again I repeat it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every hour in the day I think it, and feel it, and say it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Rose Standish died, my life has been weary and dreary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sick at heart have I been, beyond the healing of friendship.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft, in my lonely hours, have I thought of the maiden Priscilla;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is alone in the world; her father and mother and brother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Died in the winter together. I saw her going and coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now to the grave of the dead, now to the bed of the dying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patient, courageous and strong, and said to myself, that if ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were angels on earth, as there are angels in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two have I seen and known; and the angel, whose name is Priscilla,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long have I cherished the thought, but never have dared to reveal it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being a coward in this, but valiant enough for the most part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go to the damsel Priscilla, the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say that a blunt old captain, a man not of words but of actions.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not in these words, you know, but this in short is my meaning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a maker of war, and not a maker of phrases;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You, who are bred as a scholar, can say it in elegant language,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Poor John Alden, the fair-haired, timid youth, was
aghast, overwhelmed with anguish. He tried to
smile, but the nerves of his face twitched with painful
convulsions. He endeavored to excuse himself,
but his impetuous friend, whose commanding mind
overawed him, would listen to no excuse. To all
John’s remonstrances he replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">“I was never a maker of phrases.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can march up to a fortress, and summon the place to surrender;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But march up to a woman, with such a proposal, I dare not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am not afraid of bullets, nor shot from the mouth of a cannon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of a thundering ‘no!’ point blank from the mouth of a woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I confess I’m afraid of, nor am I ashamed to confess it.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>John Alden, anguish-stricken as he was, could not
refuse. The strong mind dominated over the weaker
one. Agitated, almost convulsed with contending
emotions, he entered the paths of the forest, crossed
the brook which ran south of the village, and gathering
a handful of wild flowers, almost in delirium, approached
the lonely dwelling of Priscilla. As he
drew near, he heard her sweet voice singing a hymn
as she walked to and fro beside the spinning-wheel.
Priscilla met him on the threshold, with a cordial
greeting, hoping that he had come to declare his love.
He was greatly embarrassed, and after a long parley,
very awkwardly blurted out the words, that he had
come with an offer of marriage from Captain Miles
Standish. Priscilla was amazed, grieved, wounded.
With eyes dilated with sadness and wonder, she
looked into John’s face and said, after a few moments
of ominous silence:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“If the great Captain of Plymouth is so eager to wed me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why does he not come himself and take the trouble to woo me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>John, exceedingly embarrassed, said, in unfortutunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
phrase, that the captain was very busy, and
had no time for such things. The offended maiden
replied:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Has he no time for <em>such things</em>, as you call it, before he is married;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would he be likely to find it, or make it, after the wedding?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Quite forgetting himself, John launched forth eloquently
in the praise of his military friend,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Spoke of his courage and skill, and all his battles in Flanders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How with the people of God he had chosen to suffer affliction,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, in return for his zeal, they had made him Captain of Plymouth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a gentleman born, could trace his pedigree plainly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to Hugh Standish, of Duxbury Hall, in Lancashire, England,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was the son of Ralph, and the grandson of Thurston de Standish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heir unto vast estates, of which he was basely defrauded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still bore the family arms, and had for his crest a cock argent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Combed and wattled gules, and all the rest of the blazon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a man of honor, of noble and generous nature;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he was rough, he was kindly; she knew how, during the winter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had attended the sick, with a hand as gentle as woman’s.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat hasty and hot, he could not deny it, and headstrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stern as a soldier might be, but hearty and placable always;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to be laughed at and scorned, because he was little of stature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he was great of heart, magnanimous, courtly, courageous;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any woman in Plymouth, nay, any woman in England,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might be happy and proud to be called the wife of Miles Standish.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As Priscilla listened to this glowing and eloquent
eulogy, it only increased her admiration for the young
and beautiful John Alden. She had long loved him.
Maidenly instinct taught her that she also was beloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
by him. Though this love had never been communicated
to her in words, it had again and again been
expressed in loud-speaking glances of the eye and in
actions. With tremulous voice she ventured to reply,
“Why don’t you speak for yourself, John?”</p>

<p>The tone, the look which accompanied the words,
revealed at once, to the bashful youth, the love of
Priscilla. A tempest of conflicting emotions rushed
into his soul. How could the magnanimous youth
plead his own cause, and thus apparently betray his
friend. Perplexed, bewildered, he burst from the
house, like an insane man; hurried to the sea shore,
wandered along the sands, where the surf was breaking
with loud roar; bared his head to the ocean
breeze, and endeavored in vain to cool the fever, which
seemed to burn in both body and soul. His tender
conscience condemned him as being unfaithful to his
friend.</p>

<p>He could not, without a sense of guilt, supplant
his friend; and he could not live in Plymouth and
refuse the hand of Priscilla, so delicately and yet so
decidedly proffered. Heroically he resolved to return
to England.</p>

<p>There was a vessel in the harbor which was to
sail on the morrow. The poet speaks of it as the returning
Mayflower. Chronology will hardly permit us
to accept that representation. Rose Standish died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
on the 8th of February, N. S. The Mayflower sailed,
on her return voyage, the 5th of April, but two
months after the death of the wife Captain Standish
so tenderly loved. As the frenzied youth gazed upon
the vessel riding at anchor, and rising and falling upon
the ocean swell, he exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Back will I go o’er the ocean, this dreary land will abandon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her whom I may not love, and him whom my heart has offended.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better to be in my grave, in the green old churchyard in England,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close by my mother’s side, and among the dust of my kindred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better be dead and forgotten, than living in shame and dishonor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sacred and safe and unseen, in the dark of the narrow chamber<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me my secret shall lie, like a buried jewel that glimmers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright on the hand that is dust, in the chambers of silence and darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Thus resolving he hurried, in the gathering twilight,
through the glooms of the forest to the “seven
houses” of Plymouth. He entered the door of his
home and found the Captain anxiously awaiting his
return. He had been gone long and was rather severely
reproached for his tardiness. He then gave a
minute account of the interview. But when he came
to her declaration, “Why don’t you speak for yourself,
John?” the Captain rose from his seat in a towering
passion. As he was vehemently uttering his reproaches
a messenger came, with the information that hostile
Indians were approaching. Instantly the bold
warrior forgot Priscilla, and all his displeasure at John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
Alden, in contemplation of his immense responsibilities
as military protector of the colony. Hastily he
girded on his armor and left the house. He found
the leading men already assembled in the council
room. Upon the table lay the skin of the rattlesnake,
to which we have before alluded, filled with arrows,
with the Indian who brought it, by its side. Captain
Standish at once understood the significance of the
mysterious gift. He said,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“‘Leave this matter to me, for to me by right it pertaineth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War is a terrible trade; but in the cause that is righteous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet is the smell of powder; and thus I answer the challenge.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, from the rattlesnake’s skin, with a sudden contemptuous gesture,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jerking the Indian arrows, he filled it with powder and bullets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full to the very jaws and handed it back to the savage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying in thundering tones, ‘Here, take it! this is your answer.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing the serpent’s skin, and seeming himself like a serpent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Early the next morning Captain Standish took
eight men, well armed, and marched, under the guidance
of Hobomak, to the point where he supposed
the hostile Indians were gathering. The vessel was
about to sail. The signal gun was fired. All the inhabitants
of the little village flocked to the beach.
The ship’s boat was at Plymouth rock, waiting to convey
the captain of the vessel, who was on shore, to
the ship. He was bidding his friends adieu and cramming
the capacious pockets of his storm coat with letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
and packages. John Alden, with others, was
seen hurrying down to the sea shore. The captain
stood with one foot on the rock and the other on the
gunwale of the boat, speaking his last words and just
ready to push off. Alden, in his despair, was about
to enter the boat, without any words of adieu to his
friends, thinking in absence and distance to find relief
to his tortured feelings, when he saw Priscilla
looking sadly upon him.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“But as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing dejected among them, unconscious of all that passing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed were her eyes upon his, as if she divined his intention,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed with a look so sad, so reproachful, imploring and patient,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, with a sudden revulsion, his heart recoiled from its purpose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from the verge of a crag, where one step more is destruction.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Thus influenced, he abandoned his intention of
returning to England more suddenly than he had
formed it. As he stepped back he said, with a true
lover’s fervor,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“There is no land so sacred, no air so pure and so wholesome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As is the air she breathes, and the soil that is pressed by her footsteps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here for her sake will I stay, and like an invisible presence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hover around her forever, protecting, supporting her weakness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes! as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, with the blessing of God, shall it be the last at the leaving.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The captain of the ship sprang into the boat,
waved an adieu to the lonely band of exiles, numbering
but about fifty men, women and children, who
were gathered upon the shore, and the boat, driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
by the sturdy arms of the rowers, soon reached the
ship. The anchor was raised, the sails unfurled, and
the only link which seemed to connect them with the
home of their fathers was sundered. Long the saddened
Pilgrims stood gazing upon the vessel as it receded
from their view, and then returned to their
lowly cabins, their homely fare, and to the toils and
perils of their life of exile.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“So they returned to their homes; but Alden lingered a little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Musing alone on the shore and watching the wash of the billows.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As he thus stood, lost in painful thought and almost
distracted by the perplexities in which he found
himself involved, he perceived Priscilla standing beside
him. They had a long conversation together,
which the poet manages with admirable skill. The
artless, frank, affectionate Priscilla was unwittingly
every moment exciting deeper emotions of tenderness
and admiration in the heart of her lover. And yet,
in the most painful embarrassment from respect to
his friend Miles Standish, he refrained from offering
her, as he longed to do, his hand and heart.</p>

<p>In the mean time Captain Standish, at the head
of his brave little band, was tramping through the
trails of the forest, through thickets and morasses,
over hills and across streamlets,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p><div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“All day long, with hardly a halt, the fire of his anger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning and crackling within, and the sulphurous odor of powder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent and moody he went, and much he revolved his discomfort.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>After a march of three days, he is represented as
coming to an Indian encampment. The little cluster
of huts was upon a meadow, with the gloomy forest
on one side, and the ocean surf breaking upon the
other. A few women were scattered around among
the wigwams. A formidable band of warriors, evidently
on the war path, plumed and painted, and thoroughly
armed, were gathered around their council
fires. As soon as they saw the bright armor of the
Pilgrims, as the brave little band emerged from the
forest, two of the chiefs, men of gigantic stature,
came forward to meet them. With much historic accuracy
of detail the poet describes the scene which
ensued—a scene which has been presented to the
reader in the preceding narrative.</p>

<p>One of these was Pecksuot, the other Wattawamat.
These burly savages, huge as Goliath of Gath, met
Captain Standish, at first with deceitful words, hoping
to disarm his suspicions. Through Hobbomak, the
interpreter, who had accompanied the Captain, they
proposed to barter their furs for blankets and muskets.
But they soon saw, in the flashing eyes of
Captain Standish, that he was not to be thus beguiled.
The poet, giving utterance to authentic
history in glowing verse, and making use of almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
the very expressions uttered by the savages,
writes:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Suddenly changing their tone, they began to boast and to bluster.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a lofty demeanor, thus vauntingly spake to the Captain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Now Wattawamat can see, by the fiery eyes of the Captain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Angry is he in his heart; but the heart of the brave Wattawamat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not afraid at the sight. He was not born of a woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on the mountain, at night, from an oak tree riven by lightning.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth he sprang at a bound, with all his weapons about him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouting, ‘Who is there here to fight with the brave Wattawamat?’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he unsheathed his knife, and, whetting the blade on his left hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held it aloft and displayed a woman’s face on the handle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, with bitter expression and look of sinister meaning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘I have another at home, with the face of a man on the handle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By and by they shall marry; and there will be plenty of children.’”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Pecksuot also indulged in similar language and
gesture of insult and menace, brandishing his gleaming
knife, boasting that it could eat, though it could
not speak, and telling the Captain that he was so
small in stature that he ought to go and live with the
women. Meanwhile many Indians were seen stealthily
creeping around, from bush to bush in the forest,
with the evident design of making a simultaneous attack
upon the little band of white men. Some of
these Indians were armed with muskets, others with
arrows set on their bow strings. Nearer and nearer
they were approaching, to enclose him in the net of
an ambush from which there could be no escape.
As Captain Standish watched with his eagle eye these
proofs of treachery, and listened to the insults and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
threats of the herculean chiefs, who, he knew, were
only waiting for the fit moment to leap upon him,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“All the hot blood of his race, of Sir Hugh and of Thurston de Standish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boiled and beat in his heart, and swelled in the veins of his temples.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Headlong he leaped on the boaster, and snatching his knife from its scabbard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunged it into his heart; and, reeling backward, the savage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell with his face to the sky, and a fiend-like fierceness upon it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the war-whoop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a flurry of snow, on the whistling wind of December,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This was followed by a discharge of musketry from
the Pilgrims. A bullet pierced the brain of Pecksuot,
and he fell dead. The savages, having lost both
of their chiefs, fled like deer. As the head of Wattawamat,
the gory trophy of war, was sent to Plymouth,
and was exposed on the roof of the fort, Priscilla
averted her face with terror and, shuddering,
thanked God she had not married such a man of war
as Captain Standish.</p>

<p>Month after month passed away, while the captain
is represented as scouring the land with his forces,
watching the movements of the hostile Indians, and
thwarting their intrigues. Though Priscilla had refused
his hand, the bashful John Alden did not feel
that he could, in honor, take advantage of the absence
of his friend, the Captain, and seek her for his bride.
So assuming simply the attitude of friendship, the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
lovers lived, with some degree of tranquility and in
constant intimacy, side by side.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Meanwhile, Alden at home had built him a new habitation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Solid, substantial, of timber, rough-hewn from the firs of the forest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wooden-barred was the door, and the roof was covered with rushes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Latticed the windows were, and the window-panes were of paper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oiled to admit the light, while wind and rain were excluded.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The description which the poet gives of the intercourse
between these simple children of the wilderness,
whose hearts glowed with purity and love, is
beautiful in its pastoral simplicity. At length the
tidings, very appalling to the Pilgrims, reached the
little settlement, that their redoubtable Captain had
been slain in a battle with the Indians—shot down by
a poisoned arrow. It was said that he had been led
into an ambush, and, with his whole band, had perished.
John and Priscilla were together when an Indian
brought this intelligence to Plymouth. Both joy
and grief flashed through the soul of John Alden.
His friend was dead. The bonds which had held
John captive were forever sundered. Scarcely knowing
what he did, he threw his arms around Priscilla,
pressed her to his bosom, and devoutly exclaimed,
“Those whom the Lord hath united, let no man put
them asunder.”</p>

<p>The wedding day soon came. The simple ceremony
was performed by Elder Brewster. All the Pilgrims
were present.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>It was Captain Miles. The report of his death
was unfounded. He had arrived unexpectedly in the
village (for there were no mails in those days), just
in time to be present at the close of the wedding.
With characteristic magnanimity he advanced to the
bridegroom, cordially shook his hand and wished him
joy.</p>

<p>In a similar strain he addressed the bride. The

Captain.</p>

which the poet has woven into his harmonious lines,
is accurate even in its most minute details. We have

<p>In the spring of the year 1632 an Indian runner
came, in breathless haste, into the village of Plymouth,
with the intelligence that the Narragansets,
under Canonicus, were marching against Mount Hope,
and that Massassoit implored the aid of the Pilgrims.
The chief of the Wampanoags had fled, with a party
of his warriors, to Sowams, in the present town of
Warren, R. I., where the Pilgrims had a trading-post.
It used to be said, in the French army, during the
wars of Napoleon I., that the presence of the Emperor,
on the field of an approaching battle, was
equivalent to a re-enforcement of one hundred thousand
men. It seems to have been the impression,
with both colonists and Indians, that Captain Standish,
in himself alone, was a resistless force. He was immediately
despatched to Sowams, <em>with three men</em>, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
repel an army of nobody knew how many hundreds of
savage warriors.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at Sowams, the captain soon
learned that the Wampanoags were indeed in serious
peril. The Narragansets were advancing in much
strength. Captain Standish sent promptly a messenger
to Plymouth to forward a re-enforcement to him
immediately, with powder and muskets. As there
was but little ammunition at that time in Plymouth,
application was made to Governor Winthrop, of Massachusetts,
for a supply. There were but few horses
then in either of the colonies, and the messenger
returned on foot through the woods with twenty-seven
pounds of powder upon his back, which Governor
Winthrop had contributed from his own stores. Fortunately
the Pequots, taking advantage of the absence
of the Narraganset warriors, made an inroad upon
their territory, which caused Canonicus to abandon
his march upon Sowams and to make a precipitate
retreat to defend his own realms.</p>

<p>Mr. Roger Williams, whose name is one of the most
illustrious in the early annals of New England, had a
little before this time come over to Massachusetts.
Being displeased with some things there, he left
that colony and came to Plymouth.</p>

<p>“Here,” writes Governor Bradford, “he was
friendly entertained, according to their poor ability,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
and exercised his gifts among them, and after some
time was admitted a member of the church. And
his teaching was well approved, for the benefit whereof
I still bless God, and am thankful to him, even for
his sharpest admonitions and reproofs. He this year
began to fall into some strange opinions, and from
opinion to practice; which caused some controversy
between the church and him, and, in the end, some
discontent on his part, by occasion whereof he left
them somewhat abruptly.”</p>

<p>In the year 1634 a serious difficulty occurred upon
the Kennebec River. The Plymouth colony claimed
this river, and fifteen miles on each side of it, by
special patent. They thus were enabled to monopolize
the very important trade with the Indians. A
man by the name of Hocking, from the settlement at
Piscataqua, with a boat load of goods, entered the
river, and ascending above the trading coast of the
Plymouth colony, commenced purchasing furs of the
Indians. Mr. John Howland was in command of the
post at that time. He forbade the trade; but Hocking,
with insulting language, bade him defiance.
Howland took a boat and some armed men, and
ascended the river to the spot where the heavily laden
boat of Hocking was riding at anchor, and earnestly
expostulated with him against his illegal procedings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
The result we will give in the words of Governor
Bradford:</p>

<p>“But all in vain. He could get nothing of him
but ill words. So he considered that now was the
season for trade to come down, and that if he should
suffer him to take it from them, all their former
charge would be lost, and they had better throw all
up. So consulting with his men, who were willing
thereto, he resolved to put him from his anchors, and
let him drift down the river with the stream; but
commanded the men that none should shoot a shot
upon any occasion, except he commanded them.</p>

<p>“He spoke to him again, but all in vain. Then
he sent a couple in a canoe to cut his cable, the which
one of them performs. But Hocking takes up a piece,
which he had laid ready, and, as the bark sheared
by the canoe, he shot him, close under her side, in the
head, so that he fell down dead instantly.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> One of
his fellows, who loved him well, could not hold, but
with a musket shot Hocking, who fell down dead, and
never spake word. This was the truth of the thing.”</p>

<p>Mr. John Alden, probably the husband of Priscilla,
was one of the men in the bark with the Pilgrims.
They returned to the trading post, much afflicted
by the untoward adventure. Not long after this Mr.
Alden, visiting Boston, was arrested for the deed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
upon the complaint of a kinsman of Hocking, and
held to bail. The Massachusetts government had no
right of jurisdiction in the affair. But Governor
Winthrop was quite embarrassed to know what was
best to be done in a case thus far without any precedent.
He wrote very courteously to Governor Winslow,
then Chief Magistrate of Plymouth, informing
him of what had been done, and enquiring if the Plymouth
people would take action in a case which
seemed rather to belong to their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>“This we did,” writes Governor Winthrop, “that
notice might be taken that we did disavow the said
action, which was much condemned of all men, and
which, it was feared, would give occasion to the king
to send a general governor over. And besides, it had
brought us all, and the gospel, under a common reproach,
of cutting one another’s throats for beaver.”</p>

<p>Governor Bradford was also greatly troubled, being
apprehensive respecting the influence it might
exert upon the home government. He speaks of the
occurrence as “one of the saddest things that befel
them since they came.” There was embarrassment
all around. It was hardly consistent with the dignity
of Plymouth to surrender the case to the Massachusetts
court. Mr. Alden, who had been arrested, was
no actor in the business. He simply happened to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
in the boat, having gone to the Kennebec with supplies.</p>

<p>Under these difficult circumstances Captain Standish
was sent to Massachusetts to consult with the
authorities there upon the best course to be pursued;
to make explanations, and to endeavor to obtain the
release of John Alden. Great wisdom was requisite
in discharging the duties of this mission, combining
conciliation with firmness. The Captain was equal to
the occasion. He represented that the Plymouth
people exceedingly regretted what had happened, but
they felt that they were not the aggressors, but had
acted in self defense. It was admitted that one of
their servants had shot Hocking, but that he had first
shot Talbot, and would have killed others had he not
himself been killed. It was urged that the Massachusetts
colony had no jurisdiction in the case, and
that it had done unjustly in imprisoning, and arraigning
before its court, one of the Plymouth men. The
spirit of conciliation manifested by both parties was
admirable, as is manifest in the following admission
made to the Massachusetts court, as recorded by
Governor Bradford:</p>

<p>“But yet, being assured of their Christian love,
and persuaded that what was done was out of godly
zeal, that religion might not suffer, or sin be in any
way covered, especially the guilt of blood, of which all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
should be very conscientious, they did endeavor to
appease and satisfy them the best they could; first
by informing them of the truth in all circumstances
about the matter; and secondly, in being willing to refer
the case to any indifferent and equal hearing and
judgment of the thing here, and to answer it elsewhere
when they should be duly called thereto. And
further, they craved Mr. Winthrop’s, and others of
the revered magistrates there, their advice and direction
therein. This did mollify their minds, and bring
things to a good and comfortable issue in the end.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>In accordance with Governor Winthrop’s advice,
a general conference of prominent men, both ministers
and laymen, was held in Boston. After seeking
divine guidance in prayer, the matter was very thoroughly
discussed. Then the opinion of each one was
taken, both magistrates and ministers. With entire
unanimity they came to the conclusion that, “Though
they all could have wished that these things had
never been, yet they could not but lay the blame and
guilt on Hocking’s own head. And thus,” writes
Governor Bradford, “was this matter ended, and love
and concord renewed.”</p>

<p>In the struggle between the Dutch and the English,
for the possession of the Connecticut River and
its lucrative trade, a party of Dutch ascended the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
river far above their trading-house, at the present site
of Hartford. Here there was a powerful tribe of Indians.
Being, as usual with the Indians, at war with
their neighbors, about one thousand of them had built
a fort, which they had strongly palisadoed. Some
Dutch traders went up to pass the winter with them,
and to purchase their furs. A terrible plague came
upon the Indians, and nine hundred and fifty died in
the course of a few weeks. The living could not
bury the dead. Their bodies were left to decay in
the open air. The Dutch, with difficulty, amidst the
snows of winter, made their escape from this horrible
pestilence, and succeeded, when almost dead with
hunger and cold, in reaching their friends in Hartford.</p>

<p>The account of the ravages of the small-pox among
the Indians, around the English settlements, is too
revolting to be transferred to these pages. The suffering
was awful. Though the English ministered to
them with the greatest humanity, yet not one of them
was attacked by the disease. The judgment of God
seemed to have fallen upon the Indians, and they
were everywhere perishing.</p>

<p>The Plymouth colony had a very flourishing trading-house
on the Penobscot River. In the year 1635,
a French frigate appeared in the harbor, and took
possession of the post, in the name of the king of
France. The captain, Monsieur d’ Aulney, made an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
inventory of their goods, took a bill of sale at his own
price, promised to pay when convenient, put the men
on board their shallop, supplied them amply with provisions,
and, with many bows and compliments, sent
them home to Plymouth. Once before this post had
been thus captured. The Plymouth people were
greatly disturbed by the loss. The French commander
threatened to come again the next year, with
eight ships, and to seize all the plantations in that
section of the country which was claimed by the
king of France.</p>

<p>Plymouth applied to Massachusetts to co-operate
in the endeavor to recapture the post, and to drive
out the French. The Governor of Plymouth and
Captain Standish were sent to meet the Massachusetts
commissioners. They urged that both colonies
were equally interested in the dislodgement of the
French, and that the expense should be equally borne.
But the Massachusetts commissioners insisted that
as the post belonged to Plymouth alone, that colony
ought to defray all the expenses of the expedition.
Thus the negotiation terminated.</p>

<p>Plymouth, thus left to its own resources, hired a
vessel, the Great Hope, of about three hundred tons,
well fitted with ordnance. It was agreed with its
commander that he should recapture the post, and
surrender it, with all the trading commodities which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
were there, to the agents, who were to accompany
him from Plymouth. As his recompense, he was to
receive seven hundred pounds of beaver skins, to be
delivered as soon as he should have accomplished his
task. If he failed, he was to receive nothing.</p>

<p>Thomas Prince was then Governor of Plymouth.
He sent Captain Miles Standish, in their own bark,
with about twenty men, to aid, should it be needful,
in the recovery of the post, and to take the command
there, should the post be regained. Captain Standish’s
bark led the way, and piloted the Great Hope
into the harbor, on the Penobscot. He had in his
vessel the seven hundred pounds of beaver, with
which to pay for the expedition. But Golding proved
a totally incompetent man, displaying folly almost
amounting to insanity. He would take no advice
from Captain Standish. He would not even allow
Captain Standish to summon the post to surrender.
Had this been done, the French would at once have
yielded, for they were entirely unprepared to resist
the force sent against them. Neither would he bring
his ship near enough to the post to do any execution,
as without any summons and at a great distance, he
opened a random and harmless fire.</p>

<p>Captain Standish earnestly remonstrated, assuring
Golding that he could lay his ship within pistol shot
of the house. As the stupid creature burned his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
powder and threw away his shot, the French, behind
an earth-work out of all harm’s reach, made themselves
merry over the futile bombardment. At length Golding
became convinced of his folly, and placed his vessel
upon the spot which Captain Standish had pointed
out. Then he ascertained, to the excessive chagrin
of Captain Standish and his party, that he had
expended all his ammunition. The wretch then designed
to seize upon the bark and the beaver skins.
But Captain Standish, learning of this, spread his
sails and returned in safety to Plymouth.</p>

<p>The Governor and his assistants in Massachusetts
Bay, hearing of this utter failure of the expedition,
became alarmed in reference to their own safety.
They wrote very earnestly to Plymouth, saying:</p>

<p>“We desire that you would, with all convenient
speed, send some man of trust, furnished with instructions
from yourselves, to make such agreement
with us about this business, as may be useful for you
and equal for us.”</p>

<p>Captain Standish, with Mr. Prince, was immediately
sent to Massachusetts with full powers to act in
accordance with instructions given them. The negotiations,
however, failed; as the Massachusetts
colonists were still not prepared to pay their share of
the expense. The French remained undisturbed on
the Penobscot. They carried on a vigorous trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
with the Indians, supplying them abundantly with
muskets and ammunition.</p>

<p>The terrible mortality, which had swept away so
many thousand Indians from the Connecticut, turned
the attention of the Massachusetts colonists again to
that beautiful and fertile region. The Dutch claimed
the country. The Plymouth colony claimed it. And
now the Massachusetts colonists were putting in their
claim. Jonathan Brewster, the oldest son of Elder
Brewster, was at the head of the little Plymouth
settlement at Windsor. The following extracts from
one of his letters addressed to the authorities at
Plymouth, give a very clear idea of the state of the
question at that time. The letter is dated Matianuck
(Windsor), July 6, 1835.</p>

<p>“The Massachusetts men are coming almost
daily, some by water and some by land, who are not
yet determined where to settle, though some have a
great mind to the place we are upon, and which was
last bought. Many of them look for that which this
river will not afford, except it be at this place, to be a
great town and have commodious dwellings for many
together. I shall do what I can to withstand them.
I hope that they will hear reason; as that we were
here first, and entered with much difficulty and danger,
both in regard of the Dutch and Indians, and
bought the land and have since held here a chargeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
possession, and kept the Dutch from further
encroaching, who would else, long ere this, have
possessed all, and kept out all others.</p>

<p>“It was your will that we should use their persons
and messengers kindly; and so we have done, and
do daily to your great charge. For the first company
had well nigh starved had it not been for this house;
I being forced to supply twelve men for nine days
together. And those who came last I helped the
best we could, helping them both with canoes and
guides. They got me to go with them to the Dutch,
to see if I could procure some of them to have
quiet settling near them; but they did peremptorily
withstand them. Also I gave their goods house-room,
according to their earnest request. What
trouble and charge I shall be further at I know not;
for they are coming daily, and I expect those back
again from below, whither they are gone to view the
country. All which trouble and charge we undergo
for their occasion, may give us just cause, in the
judgment of all wise and understanding men, to hold
and keep that we are settled upon.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>The question was finally settled by treaty, and the
Massachusetts colonists soon planted settlements at
Wethersfield, Hartford, and some other places on the
river. There were three dominant nations, if we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
so call them, at this time, in southern New England.
The chiefs of these nations exercised a sort of feudal
domination over many petty tribes. The Wampanoags,
under Massasoit, held the present region of
Massachusetts generally. The Narragansets, under
Canonicus, occupied Rhode Island. The Pequots,
under Sassacus, extended their dominion over nearly
the whole of Connecticut. These tribes, powerful
and jealous, were almost invariably engaged in hostilities.
Roger Williams estimated the number of
Pequots at thirty thousand souls. They could bring
four thousand warriors into the field. The seat of
their chief was at Groton, near New London. Twenty-six
smaller tribes were held in subjection by him.
The Pequots were deemed the most fierce and cruel
race of all the tribes who dwelt in New England.</p>

<p>The Narragansets were a nobler race of men.
They somewhat surpassed the Pequots in numbers,
and manifested traits of character far more generous
and magnanimous. They could bring five thousand
warriors into the field. The seat of Canonicus, their
chief, was not far from the present town of Newport.</p>

<p>The Wampanoags had suffered terribly from the
pestilence which ravaged New England just before
the arrival of the Pilgrims. The number of their
warriors had been reduced from over three thousand
to about five hundred. Early in the year 1637 the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
Pequots began to manifest decided hostility against
the English. There was a small settlement at Saybrook,
near the mouth of the Connecticut river. As
the colonists were at work in the fields, unsuspicious
of danger, a band of Indians fell upon them and killed
several men and women. The Indians retired with
loud boastings and threats. Soon after they came in
larger numbers and attacked a fort. Though they
were repelled, their attack was so bold and spirited as
to astonish the English and cause them great alarm.</p>

<p>The Pequots endeavored to make peace with the
Narragansets, that they might enter into an alliance
with them against the English. Not a little ability
was displayed in the plan of operations which they
suggested. “We have no occasion to fear,” they said,
“the strength of the English. We need not come to
open battle with them. We can set fire to their
houses, shoot their cattle, lie in ambush for them
whenever they go abroad. Thus we can utterly destroy
them without any danger to ourselves. The
English will be either starved to death, or will be
compelled to leave the country.”</p>

<p>For a time the Narragansets listened to these representations,
being quite inclined to accept them.
The anxiety of the English was very great. They
desired only peace, with the prosperity it would bring.
War and its ruin they greatly deplored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
The Pilgrims did everything which could be done
to avoid the Pequot war; but it was forced upon
them. Sassacus was a very shrewd man, and laid
very broad plans for his military operations. He could
summon thousands of warriors who would fall furiously
upon all the scattered settlements, lay them in
ashes, and massacre the inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the year 1634, just after a very flourishing trading
post had been established on the Connecticut
river at Windsor, two English traders, Captains Norton
and Stone, ascended the river in a boat, laden
with valuables for the Indian trade, which they intended
to exchange for furs. These traders had eight
white boatmen in their employ. The Indians were
peaceful, and they had no apprehensions of danger.
One night, as the boat was moored by the side of the
stream, a band of Indians, with hideous yells, rushed
from an ambush upon them, put every man to death
and, having plundered the boat of all its contents,
sunk it in the stream.</p>

<p>These traders were from Massachusetts. This
powerful colony demanded of Sassacus that the murderers
should be surrendered to them, and that payment
should be made for the plundered goods. The
bloody deed had been performed at midnight in the
glooms of the forest. There was no survivor to tell
the story. Sassacus fabricated one, very ingeniously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
to palm off upon the English. No one could deny
the villany of Captain Hunt, who, some years before,
had kidnapped several Indians and sold them into
slavery. Sassacus declared that Captains Norton and
Stone, without any provocation, had seized two Indians,
bound them hand and foot in their boat, and were
about to carry them off, no one knew where.</p>

<p>The friends of these captives crept cautiously
along the shore watching for an opportunity to rescue
them. The white men were all thoroughly armed
with swords and muskets, rendering any attempt to
rescue the captives extremely perilous. The right
of self-defense rendered it necessary, in the conflict
which would ensue, to kill. In the darkness of the
night they rushed upon the boat which was drawn up
to the shore, killed the white men and released the
captives. He also stated that all the Indians engaged
in the affray, excepting two, had since died of the
small-pox.</p>

<p>This plausible story could not be disproved. The
magistrates of Massachusetts, high-minded and honorable
men, wished to treat the Indians not merely
with justice, but with humanity. It could not be
denied that, admitting the facts to be as stated by
Sassacus, the Indians had performed a heroic act—one
for which they deserved praise rather than censure.
The Governor of Massachusetts therefore accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
this explanation, and resumed his friendly alliance
with the treacherous Pequots.</p>

<p>Roger Williams, who had taken up his residence
in Rhode Island, had secured the confidence of the
Indians to a wonderful degree. He exposed himself,
apparently, to the greatest perils, without any sense
of danger. He had acquired wonderful facility in
speaking the language of the Narragansets, in the
midst of whom he dwelt. There were still so many
indications that the Pequots were plotting hostilities,
that the Governor and Council of Massachusetts wrote
to Mr. Williams, urging him to go to the seat of Canonicus,
and dissuade him from entering into any coalition
with the Pequots, should such be in process of
formation. This truly good man immediately left his
home and embarked alone, in a canoe, to skirt the
coast of Narraganset Bay, upon his errand of mercy.
It is probable that he made this journey in a birch
canoe, paddling his way over the smooth waters of the
sheltered bays. He encountered many hardships,
and many great perils, as occasional storms arose,
dashing the surf upon the shore. After several days
of such lonely voyaging, he reached the royal residence
of Canonicus. The barbarian chieftain was
at home, and it so happened that when Mr. Williams
arrived at his wigwam, he found several Pequot
warriors there, who had come on an embassage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
from Sassacus to engage the Narragansets in
the war.</p>

<p>For three days this bold man remained alone
among these savages, endeavoring, in every way, to
thwart the endeavors of the Pequot warriors. These
agents of Sassacus were enraged at Mr. Williams’ influence
in circumventing their plans. They plotted
his massacre, and every night Mr. Williams had occasion
to fear that he would not behold the light of
another morning. But Canonicus, unlettered savage
as he was, had sufficient intelligence to appreciate
the fearlessness and true grandeur of character of Mr.
Williams. He dismissed the discomfited Pequots,
refusing to enter into any alliance with them. He
renewed his treaty of friendship with the English, and
engaged to send a large party of his warriors to co-operate
with them in repelling the threatened assault
of the Pequots.</p>

<p>The benefits thus conferred upon the English by
the efforts of Mr. Roger Williams were incalculable.
Many distant tribes, who were on the eve of joining
Sassacus, alarmed by the defection of the Narragansets,
also withdrew; and thus the Pequots were compelled
to enter upon the war with forces considerably
weaker than they had originally intended. Still they
were foes greatly to be dreaded. The English settlements
were now widely scattered, and each was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
itself feeble. The Pequots could marshal four thousand
of as fierce warriors as earth has ever seen.
A small bag of pounded corn would furnish each warrior
with food for many days. They could traverse
the forest trails with almost the velocity of the wind.
Rushing upon some unprotected hamlet at midnight,
with torch and tomahawk, they could, in one awful
hour, leave behind them but smouldering ashes and
gory corpses. Disappearing, like wolves, in the impenetrable
forest, they could again rush upon any
lonely farm-house, leagues away, and thus, with but
little danger to themselves, spread ruin far and wide.
No man in the scattered settlements could fall asleep
at night without the fear that the hideous war-whoop
of the Indian would rouse him and his family to a
cruel death before morning.</p>

<p>The Pequots were continually perpetrating new
acts of violence, while the English, with great forbearance,
were doing everything in their power to
avert the open breaking out of hostilities. To add to
the embarrassment of the English they received conclusive
evidence that Captains Norton and Stone,
with their boats’ crew, were wantonly murdered by
the Indians, and that the statement of extenuating
circumstances, made by Sassacus, was an entire fabrication.
The forbearance of the English only stimulated
the insolence of the Pequots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
In July 1635, John Oldham ventured on a trading
expedition to the Pequot country. He went as an
agent of the Massachusetts colony, one object being
to ascertain the disposition of the savages. The Indians
captured his boat, killed Captain Oldham, horribly
mutilating his body, and the rest of the crew, two
or three in number, were carried off as captives. The
time for attempts at conciliation was at an end. It
was resolved to prosecute the war with all vigor, and
so to punish the Pequots as to give them a new idea
of the power of the English, and to present a warning
to all the other savages against the repetition of such
outrages.</p>

<p>Plymouth colony furnished fifty soldiers, commanded
by Captain Miles Standish. Massachusetts
raised two hundred men. The settlements on the
Connecticut furnished ninety men. The Mohegans
and Narragansets sent to the English camp of rendezvous
about two hundred warriors, promising many
more. It was decided to strike the Pequots a sudden
and heavy blow. We cannot here enter into the details
of the fierce and decisive war which ensued.</p>

<p>These military bands rendezvoused on the shores
of Narraganset bay, and commenced a rapid march
through the forest. The Narragansets were exceedingly
jubilant in the prospect of inflicting vengeance
upon a foe who had often compelled them to bite the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
dust. As they hurried along through the narrow trails
towards the Pequot territory, volunteer Narragansets
joined them until five hundred feathered warriors
were in their train.</p>

<p>The Indian guides led them to a strong fort, on
the banks of the river Mystic. A large number of
Pequot warriors were assembled here, quite unapprehensive
of the attack which was about to fall terribly
upon them. Silently, in the night the English and
the Indians surrounded them, that there might be no
escape.</p>

<p>“And so,” writes Governor Bradford, “assaulted
them with great courage, shooting amongst them, and
entering the fort with all speed. Those that first
entered found sharp resistance from the enemy, who
both shot at and grappled with them. Others ran
into their houses, and brought out fire and set them
on fire, which soon took in their mats, and, standing
close together, with the wind, all was quickly in a
flame. Thereby more were burned to death than
were otherwise slain. It burned their bow-strings,
and rendered them unserviceable. Those that escaped
the fire were slain with the sword. Some were
hewed to pieces, others were run through with their
rapiers, so that they were quickly dispatched, and
very few escaped. It was conceived that they thus
destroyed about four hundred at this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
“It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in
the fire, the streams of blood quenching the same,
and horrible was the scent thereof. But the victory
seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave the praise
thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for
them, thus to give them so speedy a victory over so
proud and insulting an enemy.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>“The Narraganset Indians all this while stood round
about, but aloof from all danger, and left the whole
execution to the English, except it were the stopping
of any that broke away; insulting over their enemies
in this their ruin and misery, when they were writhing
in the flames. After this service was thus happily accomplished,
they marched to the water side, where
they met with some of their vessels, by which they
had refreshing with victuals and other necessaries.”</p>

<p>The war was continued with vigor, and the Pequot
warriors became nearly exterminated. Sassacus fled
to the Mohawks, in New York. They cut off his
head. Thus the war ended. The Pequots were no
longer to be feared. Driven from their homes, they
took refuge, in their dispersion, in different tribes,
and this formidable barbaric nation became extinct.</p>

<p>War is always demoralizing. Many, rioting in its
scenes of carnage and of crime, lose all sense of humanity,
and become desperadoes. After the close of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
the Pequot war, a young fellow, lusty and desperate,
by the name of Arthur Peach, who had done valiant
service in cutting down the Indians, felt a strong disinclination
to return to the monotony of peaceful life.
He became thoroughly dissolute, a wild adventurer,
ripe for any crime. To escape the consequences of
some of his misdeeds, he undertook, with three boon
companions, as bad as himself, to escape to the Dutch
colony at the mouth of the Hudson. As they were
travelling through the woods they stopped to rest,
and, kindling a fire, sat down to smoke their pipes.
An Indian came along, who had a quantity of wampum,
which had become valuable as currency, recognized
by all the tribes. They invited him to sit down
and smoke with them. As they were thus smoking together,
Peach said to his companions that he meant
to kill the Indian, “for the rascal,” said he, “has undoubtedly
killed many white men.” The Indian, who
did not understand English, was unsuspicious of danger.
Peach, watching his opportunity, thrust his
sword through his body once or twice, and taking
from him his wampum and some other valuables, he
and his companions hurried on their way, leaving him
as they supposed, dead.</p>

<p>Though mortally wounded, the Indian so far revived
as to reach some of his friends, when, having
communicated to them the facts of the murder, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
died. The men were all arrested. The proof was so
positive that they made no denial of their guilt. They
were all condemned, and three were executed, one
having made his escape. Francis Baylies, commenting
upon this occurrence, writes:</p>

<p>“This execution is an undeniable proof of that
stern sense of duty which was cherished by the Pilgrims.
To put three Englishmen to death for the
murder of one Indian, without compulsion, or without
any apprehension of consequences, for it does not
appear that any application was made on the part of
the Indians, for the punishment of the murderers,
and they might have been pacified by the death of
one, and probably even without that, denotes a degree
of moral culture unknown in new settlements.
It stands in our annals without a parallel instance.
The truth of the fact is avouched by all our early historians,
and it stands an eternal and imperishable
monument of stern, unsparing, inflexible justice.
And, in all probability it was not without its earthly
reward, for the Indians, convinced of the justice of
the English, abstained from all attempts to avenge
their wrongs, by their own acts, for many years.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>The Plymouth colonists were still much embarrassed
in consequence of their relations with their
partners in England, to whom they were still considerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
indebted. The agent of the company there
wrote that he could not make up his accounts, unless
some one from the colony should come over to England
to aid him; and he urged that Mr. Winslow
should be sent. But Mr. Winslow was afraid to go.
Neither was he willing that any of his partners should
go. The angry tone of letters from England led him
to apprehend serious danger. “For he was persuaded,”
writes Governor Bradford, “that if any of
them went they would be arrested, and an action of
such a sum laid upon them as they should not procure
bail, but must lie in prison; and then they would
bring them to what they list.”</p>

<p>Still it was very important that some one should
go. Captain Standish was applied to. He seems to
have had as little fear of an English prison as of the
tomahawks and arrows of the Indians. Without any
hesitancy he was ready to embark in the perilous enterprise.
But upon mature deliberation his more
cautious friends decided it not to be prudent to expose
him to such peril. But the spirit of justice,
which inspired them in all their transactions, is again
conspicuous. They offered to submit the matter to
any gentlemen and merchants of the Massachusetts
colony, whom the company in England themselves
might choose. Before these commissioners both sides
should have a hearing. “We will be bound,” they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
added, “to stand by their decision, and make good
their award, though it should cost us all we have in
the world.”</p>

<p>The company in England declined this magnanimous
offer. In the year 1645 Elder Brewster died, at
the advanced age of eighty-four years. He was in
Duxbury the next neighbor and the ever warm friend
of Miles Standish. Among the remarkable men who
composed the Plymouth colony, he was one of the
most remarkable. By birth, education and wealth he
occupied a high position in English society. In his
earlier days he was the companion of ministers of
state. He was familiar with the magnificence of
courts, having represented his sovereign in foreign
embassage. His ample fortune had accustomed him
to the refinements and elegances of life. He might
doubtless have spent his days in ease, honor and opulence.
But, true to his religious convictions, all these
he cast aside to share the lot of the humble and persecuted
Puritans. He deemed conformity to the mode
of worship adopted by the Parliament as sinful. And
“he chose rather to suffer affliction with the people
of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.”
In the records of the first church in Plymouth
we find a very noble tribute to his memory, probably
written by Secretary Morton. Speaking of his embassage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
in his early manhood, to the Low Countries,
with Mr. Davison, Mr. Morton writes,</p>

<p>“He received possession of the cautionary towns;
and, in token thereof, the keys of Flushing being delivered
to him in her majesty’s name, he kept them
for some time, and committed them to his servant,
who kept them under his pillow on which he slept,
the first night, and, on his return the States honored
him with a gold chain, which his master committed to
him, and commanded him to wear it when they arrived
in England, as they rode through the country
until they came to the court.</p>

<p>“Afterwards he went and lived in the country, in
good esteem among his friends and the good gentlemen
of those parts, especially the godly and religious.
He did much good in the country where he
lived, in promoting and furthering religion, not only
by his practice and example, and encouraging others,
but by procuring good preachers for the places thereabouts,
and drawing on others to assist and help forward
in such a work, he himself commonly deepest in
the charge and often above his abilities. In this state
he continued many years, doing the best good he
could, and walking according to the light he saw, until
the Lord revealed further unto him.</p>

<p>“And, in the end, by the tyranny of the bishops
against godly preachers and people, in silencing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
one, and persecuting the other, he, with many more
of those times, began to look further into particulars,
and to see into the unlawfulness of their callings, and
the burden of many anti-Christian corruptions, which
both he and they endeavored to cast off, as they also
did.</p>

<p>“After they were joined into communion he was
a special stay and help to them. They ordinarily met
at his house on the Lord’s day, which was within the
manor of a bishop. With great love he entertained
them when they came, making provision for them to
his great charge, and continued so to do while they
should remain in England. And when they were to
remove out of the country, he was the first in all adventures.
He was the chief of those who were taken
at Boston, in Lincolnshire, and suffered the greatest
loss, and one of the seven that were kept longest in
prison, and after bound over to the assizes.</p>

<p>“After he came to Holland he suffered much
hardship, after he had spent the most of his means,
having a great charge and many children. And in
regard to his former breeding and course, not so fit
for many employments as others were, especially such
as were toilsome and laborious. Yea, he ever bore
his condition with much cheerfulness and content.
Towards the latter part of those twelve years, spent
in Holland, his outward condition was mended, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
lived well and plentiful; for he fell into a way, by
reason he had the Latin tongue, to teach many students,
who had a desire to learn the English tongue.
By his method they quickly attained it, with great
facility, for he drew rules to learn it by after the Latin
manner. And many gentlemen, both Danes and
Germans, resorted to him, as they had time, from
their other studies, some of them being great men’s
sons.</p>

<p>“But now, removing into this country, all these
things were laid aside again, and a new course of
living must be framed unto; in which he was in no
way unwilling to take his part, and to bear his burden
with the rest, living many times without bread or
corn, many months together; having many times
nothing but fish, and often wanting that also; and
drunk nothing but water for many years together,
until five or six years of his death. And yet he lived,
by the blessing of God, in health until very old age.”</p>

<p>Elder Brewster was an accomplished gentleman,
a genial friend, an eloquent preacher, and a fervent
Christian. History has transmitted to us the record
of but few characters so well balanced in all energetic,
harmonious, and lovely traits. He died as he had
lived, tranquilly, peacefully, in the enjoyment of all
his faculties. His sickness was short, confining him
to his bed but one day. He could converse with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
friends until within a few hours of his last breath.
About ten o’clock in the evening of April 18th, 1644,
he fell asleep.</p>

<p>It is greatly to the credit of Captain Miles Standish,
the puritan soldier, that his life-long friend was
William Brewster, the puritan divine. Their farms
in Duxbury were side by side. The scene upon which
this noble Christian man looked, in the evening of his
eventful life, must have been one full of peaceful
beauty, as he stood, staff in hand, upon the threshold of
his lowly, yet comfortable cottage. His peaceful home
was situated about three miles across the bay from the
village of Plymouth. By land it was a roundabout
route of nearly eight miles. His farm was on a picturesque
peninsula shooting out southerly into the
placid waters of Plymouth Bay. In his life of fourscore
years and four, he had witnessed the long reigns
of three of the most remarkable of the English sovereigns.</p>

<p>The days of his early manhood were passed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
scenes of persecution and suffering, whose vicissitudes
were painful and agitating in the extreme. His mental
energies had been strengthened by the discipline
of adversity and severe afflictions. As an exile, he
had encountered poverty and had been exposed to
the most severe deprivations and toils. He had
landed, with a feeble band, in this New World when
it was but a howling wilderness, and where the utmost
courage and prudence were requisite, to save
the little colony from utter extinction by a savage
foe.</p>

<p>He had lived to see the colony securely established,
to see the Indians to a very great degree conciliated,
and not a few of them brought under the influence
of Christian example and instruction. From
one little settlement, of seven log huts, he had seen
others springing up all around, till eight flourishing
towns were established, with eight churches, under
eight pastors. He had seen the colony reduced to
but fifty souls, men, women and children. And, ere
he died, the census reported a population of eight
thousand, with a well-defined government, a free constitution
and established laws. Infant colonies were
rising in various points to a vigorous manhood, and
were uniting in a confederacy, already sufficiently
powerful to repel all native foes, and which gave
promise of being able, ere long, to maintain independence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
against the machinations of all foreign enemies.</p>

<p>A system of common schools was established,
which even then was the glory of New England.
Harvard University, modelled after the renowned university
of Cambridge in England, was already beginning
to train young men for the highest offices in the
church and the state. Thus freedom, education and
religion were walking hand in hand. In the retrospect
of his path through life, this thoughtful, devout
and hopeful man could contemplate the stern conflicts,
the cruel errors, and the heroic deeds of one of
the most important eras in the world’s history. Though
he had sown in tears, he could hopefully look forward
to the time when his children, and his children’s
children should reap in joy. In speaking of the death
of this eminent man, Governor Bradford writes, under
date of the year 1643:<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>“I am to begin this year with that which was a
matter of great sadness and mourning unto them all.
About the 18th of April died their reverend elder,
and my dear and loving friend, Mr. William Brewster,
a man who had done and suffered much for the
Lord Jesus and the gospel’s sake, and had borne his
part in weal and woe with this poor persecuted church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
above thirty-six years in England, Holland, and in
this wilderness, and done the Lord and them faithful
service in his place and calling. And notwithstanding
the many troubles and sorrows he passed
through, the Lord upheld him to a great age. He
was near fourscore years of age, if not all out, when
he died.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> He had this blessing added by the
Lord to all the rest, to die in his bed, in peace
among the midst of his friends, who mourned and
wept over him, and ministered what help and comfort
they could unto him, and he again recomforted them
while he could.</p>

<p>“His sickness was not long, and till the last day
thereof, he did not wholly keep his bed. His speech
continued till somewhat more than half a day, and
then failed him. About nine or ten o’clock that evening
he died, without any pangs at all. A few hours
before his death he drew his breath short, and some
few minutes before his last he drew his breath long,
as a man falling into a sound sleep, without any pangs
or gaspings, and so sweetly departed this life unto a
better. I would now demand of any, what was he the
worse for any former sufferings? What do I say—worse?
Nay, sure he was the better, and they now
added to his honor. ‘It is a manifest token,’ saith
the apostle, ‘of the righteous judgment of God, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
ye may be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God,
for which ye also suffer; seeing it is a righteous thing
with God to recompense tribulation to them that
trouble you; and to you who are troubled, rest with
us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven
with his mighty angels.’ What though he wanted the
riches and pleasures of the world in this life, and
pompous monuments at his funeral, yet the just shall
be blessed, when the name of the wicked shall rot,
with their marble monuments.”</p>

<p>A very pleasing account is given by Prince, of the
mode in which public worship was conducted by these
Christians, who were anxious in all things to be conformed
to the habits of the disciples in apostolic days.
The customs they observed have been transmitted to
the present times in our meetings for conference and
prayer. On Thursday, the 25th of October, 1632,
Governor Winthrop, with Mr. Wilson, who was pastor
of the church in Boston, with several other Christian
friends, made a visit to Plymouth. They were
received with great hospitality. Governor Bradford,
Rev. Mr. Brewster, the ruling elder, and several others
of the prominent men of Plymouth, came some
distance out from the village to meet their friends,
who probably travelled on foot. They were conducted
to the house of Governor Bradford, where most of
them were entertained during their stay. They were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
however, every day invited to dinner parties at the
houses of the more opulent of the villagers.</p>

<p>On Sunday the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper
was administered, in the morning. The service occupied
the whole time. In the afternoon devotions,
the service was opened by Mr. Roger Williams, who
propounded a question of theology, or of conscience,
upon which he made sundry remarks. Rev. Mr.
Smith, pastor of the Boston church, then spoke briefly
upon the subject. Mr. Williams again spoke, quoting
freely from the Bible in explanation of the question
which he had proposed. Then Governor Bradford,
who had studied Hebrew, and was familiar with
all scriptural antiquities, expressed his views upon
the subject. He was followed by Elder Brewster.
His reputation, as a man of profound learning, caused
all to listen attentively when he spake. Then, by
special invitation from the Elder, Governor Winthrop
spoke upon the question, followed by Mr. Wilson,
pastor of the church in Boston. Deacon Fuller, who
was also the physician of the colony at Plymouth,
then called for the contribution for the support of
public worship and of the poor. The Governor, and
all the rest of the congregation rose from their seats
and went to the deacon’s seat to deposit their gifts.
The exercises were closed with the benediction.</p>

<p>This peculiarity of having various members of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
church speak in public worship, one after another,
they brought with them from Holland, such having
been the practice adopted by Rev. Mr. Robinson,
founded on the primitive practice of the church at
Corinth, as recorded by St. Paul, in chapter xiii.
of the Acts, 14th and 15th verses. But, as the community
advanced in intelligence, it was found that
study was essential to the teacher who, Sabbath after
Sabbath, would interest a congregation. It was also
remembered that such a practice was peculiarly
adapted to the age of inspiration which had passed
away. Thus the practice was gradually laid aside
for the mode of worship now adopted by all the
churches descended from the Puritans. The highly
educated preacher, in the stated services of the sanctuary,
brings from his treasury things new and old for
the benefit of the church and congregation. But in
frequent meetings for conference and prayer, all the
brethren of the church have an opportunity of expressing
their views upon all questions of faith and
practice.</p>

<p>There was probably no more sincere mourner, at
the grave of Elder Brewster, than his life-long companion
and friend, Captain Miles Standish. As we
have mentioned, their farms in Duxbury were side by
side. They had gathered around them several men of
congenial spirit, among whom we find the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
John Alden. From whatever direction one approaches
the homes of these illustrious men, he sees looming
up before him the remarkable eminence known as
“Captain’s Hill.” It is an oval-shaped mound, rising
to the height of about one hundred and eighty feet.
This hill was on the farm of Captain Standish. From
its summit, scenery of landscape and water was presented,
in a calm summer’s day, such as can scarcely
be surpassed in beauty in any country.</p>

<p>In a clear atmosphere one can discern, in the far
distance of the eastern horizon, over the bay, the outline
of the sand-hills of Cape Cod, with its sickle bend
forming in the extreme north the harbor where the
Mayflower first cast anchor; and where for five
long weeks their shattered bark rested while the
Pilgrims were in vain seeking for a home. Almost at
one’s feet is to be seen the whole expanse of Plymouth
Bay, with the entrance through which their
storm-shattered shallop passed through the foaming
breakers on either side. There was then no light-house
on Gurnet’s Point to guide their endangered
keel. Just before you is Clark’s Isle, under whose
lee, in the midnight tempest, the Pilgrims found
shelter, when every moment in danger of being submerged
by the waves; and where they passed the
ever-memorable Sabbath.</p>

<p>From the summit of the hill, all the land to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
south belonged to Captain Standish. On the east,
spreading out to the water’s edge, including what is
called the Nook, were the acres allotted to Elder
Brewster. Near the site of the humble house which
he reared and occupied, are still to be seen the
gray and decaying remains of a farm-house, and its
outbuildings, erected by some one of his immediate
successors. It was from this spot that the remains
of the Elder were conveyed, in long procession winding
around the western shore of the bay, to their
final resting-place on Burial Hill.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of these peaceful scenes that
Captain Miles Standish passed the evening of his
days, mainly engaged in agricultural pursuits. But
whenever serious trouble came, his energies were
immediately called into requisition.</p>

<p>When the English commenced their settlements
on Connecticut River, Uncas, sachem of the Mohegan
Indians, acknowledged a sort of feudal submission to
Sassacus, the powerful chief of the Pequot tribe.
This chieftain had, as we have mentioned, twenty-six
minor sachems, who paid him feudal homage. Uncas
was a very ambitious, energetic man, and he was
gradually bringing minor tribes under his sway. His
territory was situated east of the Connecticut River
and north of New London, Stonington and Norwich.
Uncas, though a friend of the white men, was bitterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
hostile to the introduction of Christianity among the
Indians. Some occasion of war arose between the
Narragansets and the Mohegans, and a very large
force of the former fell upon Uncas, and slew a large
number of his men, while they wounded more. This
was in the year 1645, two years after the death of
Elder Brewster. Many of the Narragansets had
obtained muskets. Being superior in numbers to the
Mohegans, and more powerfully armed, they gained
an easy victory.</p>

<p>The English were not willing to see their friend
and ally thus destroyed. They were bound by treaty
to defend him, and sent to the Narragansets a remonstrance.
The Narragansets, having engaged the co-operation
of the Mohawks, and flushed with victory,
returned an insulting and defiant answer. The Connecticut
colonists immediately despatched forty well-armed
men, for the protection of their ally, while
commissioners from the several English colonies met,
at Boston, to decide upon what further measures to
adopt. Three messengers were sent to the Narragansets
and to the Mohegans, calling upon both parties
to appoint commissioners to confer with the
English upon the points in dispute, and thus to
settle the question by diplomacy and not by butchery.
If the Narragansets refused to accede this
proposal, which they were bound, by previous treaty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
to respect, they were to be informed that the English
had already sent forty armed men to Uncas,
and a definite answer was demanded to the question
whether they intended to abide by the treaty of peace,
into which they had entered with the English, or
whether they intended to make war upon them also.</p>

<p>To this perfectly just and friendly message, the
Narragansets returned again a contemptuous and
threatening reply. At the same time Roger Williams,
who dwelt in the near vicinity, almost in the midst of
the Narragansets, and who was familiar with all their
operations, wrote to the Governors of Plymouth and
of Massachusetts, stating that the war would soon
break out far and wide, with great violence, and the
whole country would be in flames. This was alarming
tidings to the English. By the arts of peace alone
could they be enriched, and for peace and friendship
their hearts yearned.</p>

<p>The Narragansets were not far from Plymouth.
The fiend-like warfare of the savages, with their hideous
yells, tomahawks and firebrands, would first fall
upon the scattered farm-houses of that colony. An
immediate convention was called of the magistrates,
elders and chief military commanders of the Massachusetts
and Plymouth colonies. They came unanimously
to the following decisions, That they were
bound, by treaty, to aid and defend Uncas; that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
aid was not intended merely to defend him in his fort,
or when attacked in his dwelling, but also to enable
him to preserve his liberty and his estates; that this
aid must be immediately furnished or Uncas would
be overwhelmed and ruined by his enemies; that the
war against the Narragansets being so manifestly just,
the reasons for it ought to be proclaimed to the world;
that a day of humiliation and prayer should be appointed
to implore the Divine guidance and blessing;
that three hundred men should be immediately sent
to the aid of Uncas, of which Massachusetts should
furnish one hundred and ninety, Plymouth forty,
Connecticut forty, and New Haven thirty; that, considering
the immediate danger of Uncas, forty men
should be instantly sent to his succor from Massachusetts.</p>

<p>In accordance with the promptness which has ever
characterized the Massachusetts colony, scarcely an
hour elapsed, after the tidings reached Boston, ere the
men were on the march. Governor Bradford, speaking
of the insolent tone adopted by the Narragansets, writes,</p>

<p>“They received the English commissioners with
scorn and contempt, and told them that they would
have no peace with Uncas without his head. They
also gave them this further answer,—that it mattered
not who began the war, they were resolved to follow
it up, and that the English should withdraw their garrison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
from Uncas, or they would bring down the Mohawks
upon them. And withal they gave them this
threatening answer, that they would lay the English
cattle on heaps as high as their houses, and that no
Englishman should step out of his door but that he
should be shot.”</p>

<p>The English commissioners needed guides to lead
them through the wilderness of the Narraganset
country, to communicate the reply of the Narraganset
chiefs to Uncas. They refused to furnish them
with any guide. At last, in scorn they brought forward
a poor, old, decrepit Pequot woman saying, with
derisive laughter, that they might take her if they
pleased. In addition to all these indignities the commissioners
were seriously menaced with personal violence.
As their interpreter was communicating his
message to the sachems, three burly savages came
and stood behind him, brandishing their tomahawks
in the most insulting and threatening manner. The
friendly Indians, who had accompanied the English,
were so alarmed by this conduct of the Narragansets
that they fled in the utmost haste, leaving the commissioners
to go home alone.</p>

<p>“Thus,” writes Governor Bradford, “while the
commissioners in care of the public peace sought
to quench the fire kindled among the Indians, these
children of strife breathe out threatenings, provocation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
and war against the English themselves. So
that unless they should dishonor and provoke God by
violating a just engagement, and expose the colonies
to contempt and danger from the barbarians, they cannot
but exercise force, when no other means will prevail
to reduce the Narragansets and their confederates
to a more just and sober temper.”</p>

<p>The Plymouth colonists were as prompt in action
as those of Massachusetts. Captain Miles Standish
was of course placed at the head of the command.
With rapid steps his little army of forty men traversed
the forest to the appointed rendezvous at Seekonk,
now Rehoboth. Having a much shorter journey to
take, he was encamped upon the spot before the Massachusetts
men reached it. The Connecticut and
New Haven forces also soon arrived. Quite a large
number of friendly Indian warriors also joined them.
They were armed with muskets, and placed under
the command of Captain Standish.</p>

<p>All these measures were adopted with the greatest
energy and promptness. The sachem of the Narragansets
had, a short time before, sent a present to
the Governor of Massachusetts. It was intended
either to blind him as to their hostile designs, or to
bribe him not to interpose in behalf of the Mohegans.
But the Governor was not thus to be duped. He
frankly informed the messenger that he was not fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
satisfied respecting the friendly intentions of the sachem
of the Narragansets,—that he could not, therefore,
immediately accept the present. He would not
however refuse it, but would lay it aside to wait the
developments of the future.</p>

<p>The military bands being now all assembled at
Rehoboth and ready to march into the territory of the
Narragansets, the Governor of Massachusetts, before
commencing hostilities, sent two commissioners, with
an interpreter, to return the present to the Narraganset
sachem, and to inform him that he had already
sent forty men for the protection of Uncas, and that
another armed force was on the march to defend him.
They were also directed to inform the Narraganset
sachem that the English troops had express orders to
stand only upon his and their own defence; that they
should make no attempt to invade the Narraganset
country; and that if the sachem would make reparation
for the wrongs which he had already inflicted
upon the Mohegans, and would give security for his
peaceful conduct in future, he would find that the
English were as desirous of peace, and as reluctant
to shed Narraganset blood, as they ever had been. In
conclusion, this messenger, seeking only peace, said:</p>

<p>“If, therefore, Pessecus and Innemo, with the
other sachems, will, without further delay, come to
Boston, they shall have free liberty to come and return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
without molestation, or any just grievance from
the English. But deputies will not now serve; nor
may the preparations in hand be now stayed, or the
directions given recalled, till the forementioned sagamores
come, and some further order be taken. But
if the Narragansets will have nothing but war, the
English are providing for it, and will proceed accordingly.”</p>

<p>These wise measures accomplished the desired
results. The Narraganset sachems had sufficient intelligence
to perceive that they were arraying against
themselves forces which they were but poorly able to
withstand. Three of their most prominent chiefs,
with a large array of warriors, after a few days visited
Boston, and entered into a treaty of peace.</p>

<p>The Indians agreed to pay to Massachusetts two
thousand fathoms of good white wampum, in payments
extending through two years; to restore to Uncas all
the captives, men, women and children they had
taken, and all the canoes, and to pay in full for the
corn they had destroyed or carried away. They also
agreed to meet the commissioners from the several
colonies at New Haven, and submit to their arbitration
those grievances which would otherwise result in
war. There were one or two other articles in the
treaty of a similar nature. Four children of the sachems
were, within fourteen days, to be surrendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
as hostages to the English, to be tenderly cared for
by them, until the terms of the treaty should be fulfilled.
Thus happily this menace of war was dispelled.</p>

<p>A little while before the events which we have
above recorded, a serious design was entertained of
abandoning the location at Plymouth and removing to
some place where they would find richer soil. Not
only was the soil at Plymouth so barren that it would
scarcely repay cultivation, but the harbor was incommodious
and shallow. Several general meetings
were held, and the subject was very thoroughly discussed.
Many had already moved to other locations,
and the church had thus become seriously
weakened.</p>

<p>“Some,” writes Governor Bradford, “were still for
staying together in this place, alleging that men and
women might here live, if they would be content with
their condition. And it was not for want of necessities
so much they removed, as for the enriching of
themselves. Others were resolute upon removal, and
so signified that here they would not stay; that if the
church did not remove, they must; insomuch that
many were swayed, rather than that there should be
a dissolution of the church, to condescend to a removal,
if a fit place could be found, that might more
conveniently and comfortably receive the whole, with
such accession of others as might come to them, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
their better strength and subsistence, and some such
like cautions and limitations.”</p>

<p>A committee of the church was chosen, by advice
of Governor Bradford, to select a place to move to.
They repaired to Nauset, on Cape Cod, where is now
the town of Eastham. The report they brought back
was so much in favor of the place that the large majority
of the church consented to remove there. But
it was soon found that they had by no means improved
their condition by the removal. The result is
graphically described by Governor Bradford:</p>

<p>“Now they began to see their error, that they had
given away already the best and most commodious
places to others, and now wanted them themselves.
For this place was about fifty miles from here, and at
an outside of the country, remote from all society.
Also it would prove so strait as it would not be competent
to receive the whole body, much less be capable
of any addition or increase. Thus, in a short time,
they would be worse there than they are now here.
The which, with sundry other like considerations and
inconveniences, made them change their resolutions.
But such as were before resolved upon removal took
advantage of this agreement, and went on, notwithstanding;
neither could the rest hinder them, they
having made some beginning. Thus was this poor
church left, like an ancient mother, grown old and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
forsaken of her children, though not in their affections,
yet in regard to their bodily presence and personal
helpfulness. Her ancient members being most
of them worn away by death; and these of later times
being like children translated into other families, and
she, like a widow, left only to trust in God. Thus
she that had made many rich became herself poor.”</p>

<p>It required sleepless vigilance and the wisest
measures to keep peace with the Indians. There
were now, in the several colonies, many individual
white men who were totally unprincipled. No power
of law could restrain them from insulting and abusing
the Indians. The ignorant savages had very inadequate
conceptions of justice, and avenged themselves
upon any white men who fell into their hands. One
of these miscreant white men, who was running away
from Massachusetts, was killed by an Indian, in the
woods between Fairfield and Stamford. No one
knows whether the Indian had any provocation to
commit the deed. The murderer was demanded by
the Massachusetts authorities. The sachem of the
tribe promised to deliver him to the English, bound.
Ten Englishmen were sent to receive the prisoner.
The Indians, who were in charge of the captive, as
soon as they came in sight of the English party, cut
his bands and he fled like a deer into the woods.
Upon this the English seized eight of the Indians, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
two sachems, and held them in close captivity
for two days, until they received, from the
chiefs, satisfactory promises that the murderer should
be delivered to them.</p>

<p>About a week after this, a wandering Indian came
to a lonely hut in Stamford, and finding a woman
alone, killed her, as he supposed, and robbed the
house. All the Indians in that region seemed angry,
sullen, and often insulting. It was not deemed safe
for the English to travel, unless well armed and in
some strength. A vigilant watch had to be kept
night and day. This was a very uncomfortable state
of things, but no remedy could be devised for it. So
many had moved from Plymouth that the little village
was quite in a state of decay. Duxbury, where Miles
Standish had taken his farm, was, as we have mentioned,
at a distance of eight miles from Plymouth.
Francis Baylies, alluding to the place in the year
1830, writes:</p>

<p>“The extensive pine forest, the certain evidence
of sandy and barren soil, which even now almost
skirts the ancient town of Plymouth on the south and
the west, prevented any extension of population in
that direction, and on the east the ocean was its
boundary. So unconquerable is the barrenness of
this region, that even now the wild deer makes his
lair in the same place where deer were hunted by our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
forefathers two centuries ago, and a few wretched
Indians inhabit the primeval woods in which their
ancestors disdained to dwell.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Fear of the Indians, with whom hostilities were
liable at any time to break out, prevented the colonists
from selecting farms far inland. The strong settlements
on Massachusetts Bay induced the Plymouth
people to extend their settlements along the ocean
shore in that direction. The second church of the
Plymouth colony was established at Duxbury.</p>

<p>The house which Captain Standish occupied here
during the long evening of his eventful life, was situated
on the southeastern part of the peninsula, where
the remains of the cellar, which he probably dug, are
still to be seen. The house in Duxbury, now called
the Standish House, was built by his son, Alexander,
partly it is supposed from timbers taken from the old
house. This fact seems to be substantiated from the
appearance of the beams, which bear the traces of a
peculiar saw, which was used before the introduction
of saw-mills. The hearthstone also, as well as the
doors and latchings, were doubtless used in the paternal
home. It was by the side of that fireplace that
the heroic captain sat and mused, while the storms of
a New England winter shook his dwelling. The timbers
are of oak, and very sound and strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
Upon the south side of Captain’s Hill there is a
large rock, called the Captain’s Chair. Near this spot
the original barn was erected. The farm comprised
about one hundred and fifty acres, and contained
some of the most fertile land to be found in the
county of Plymouth. Other parts of the town are
sandy and unproductive. Clark’s Island, where the
explorers of Plymouth Bay passed their first Sabbath,
is said to possess, in some parts, a rich soil, which can
scarcely be surpassed in any country. “While the
northern and western sides offer the most desirable
qualities for pasturage and grain, its southern and
eastern declivities present a perfect garden, abounding
with trees, through whose foliage, even during
the summer’s hottest months, stir the breezes from
the sea.”</p>

<p>The historian of Duxbury describes the scene
now witnessed from the summit of Captain’s Hill,
and endeavors to give expression to the emotions
which the view must awaken in every reflective mind.
He writes:</p>

<p>“Select, should you visit it, the closing hours of a
summer’s day, when the burning heat of the declining
sun is dispelled by the cooler shades of approaching
evening, and ascend to its height. Now as the retiring
rays of day form on the heavens above a gorgeous
canopy of variegated hues, so on nature’s face below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
all brightens into richness, and the verdure of her
covering softens into mildness; the shining villages
around, and the village spires towering against a
background of unfading green, add gladness to the
scene. The glassy surface of the bay within, with its
gentle ripplings on the shore beneath, the music of
the dashing waves on the beach without, give quiet
to the mind and peace within.</p>

<p>“Before you, in the distance at the east, appear
the white sand-hills of Cape Cod, shining beyond
the blue expanse, and seeming to encircle by its protecting
barrier a spot dear to the heart of every descendant
of that Pilgrim band. Still nearer, at your
feet and before you, are the pleasant bays of Plymouth,
Kingston, and Duxbury, enlivened by passing
boats, and sheltered by the beach from a raging
ocean, crowned at its southern extremity by a light-house,
and with the extending arm of Saquish enclosing
the Island of the Pilgrims; turning your eyes to
the south, they fall in succession on the promontory
of Manomet; on the ancient town of Plymouth, rising
beneath, and—as if under the protection of the mound
beyond, the resting-place of the Pilgrim’s dead—on
the villages of Rocky Nook and of Kingston.</p>

<p>“Extending your eye over the extent of forest to
the northwest, you see the Blue Hills of Milton, ascending
far above the surrounding country; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
nearer, at the north, are the villages of Duxbury and
Marshfield, scattered over the fields, whose white cottages,
shining in the sun, offer a pleasing contrast to
the scene. Below you and around you once arose the
humble abode of the Pilgrims. Who can gaze upon
the spot which marks the site of the dwelling of
Standish, without feelings of emotion? who can but
give thanks that that <span class="locked">spirit—</span></p>

<p class="in0">had been sent amongst them, to be their counsel in
peace and their protection in danger? Who can but
admire its ready adaptation to a sphere of action so
totally different from the school of his youth? Here
also arose the dwellings of Brewster, who having followed
in his youth the retinue of kings and princes,
preferred a solitary retreat in the western wilds, and
there to worship his God in peace. Here, too, was
the abode of Collier, who, under every circumstance
of danger, strove with unceasing toil in the discharge
of every duty necessary to the welfare and prosperity
of the colony. Here, too, can be seen the spot
whereon the habitation of Alden was, whose prudent
counsels and whose rigid justice attained for him a
rank in the estimation of the colony, alike an honor to
himself, and a subject of pride to his descendants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
Turn your vision as you may, and you will feel that
you are gazing on a scene of more than ordinary interest,
full of the most grateful recollections, and of
a nature the most agreeable and pleasing.</p>

<p>“Rose, the first wife of Myles Standish, died at
Plymouth, January 29, 1621, about a month after the
landing. She was among the first to succumb to the

<p>None of the particulars of the last hours of Captain
Standish have been transmitted to our day. So
far as is known he enjoyed good health until his last
sickness. His will was dated March 1st, 1655. In
it he expressed the wish that, should he die at Duxbury,
his body should be buried by the side of his two
dear daughters, Lora Standish, and Mary Standish,
his daughter-in law. One-third part of his estate he
bequeathed to his dear and loving wife, Barbara Standish.
The following extract from his will indicates
the devout character of the man:</p>

<p>“I do, by this my will, make and appoint my loving
friends, Mr. Timothy Hatherly and Captain James
Cudworth, supervisors of this my last will; and that
they will be pleased to do the office of Christian love,
to be helpful to my poor wife and children, by their
Christian counsel and advice; and if any difference
should arise, which I hope will not, my will is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
my said supervisors shall determine the same, and
that they see that my poor wife shall have as comfortable
maintainance as my poor state will bear, the
whole time of her life, which if you my loving friends
please to do, though neither they nor I shall be able
to recompense, I do not doubt that the Lord will.”</p>

<p>There is a tradition that Captain Standish’s second
wife, Barbara, was a sister of his first wife, Rose.
When the Mayflower sailed, she was left an orphan
in England. She afterwards reached the colony a
full grown woman, and became the wife of the Captain.</p>

<p>Captain Standish died the 3d of October, 1656.
But his character and achievements were such that
for two hundred years since his death, his name has
been one of the most prominent in our retrospects of
the Pilgrim days. His descendants are very numerous.
For some time it has been, by these his descendants,
in contemplation to rear a monument to
his memory. On the 17th of August, 1871, there
was a very large gathering of these descendants at
Duxbury, to consecrate the spot on Captain’s Hill,
where the monument was to be reared. Many others,
of the most distinguished men of our land, were also
present, who wished to unite in this tribute to the
memory of one of the most illustrious names in American
annals. President U. S. Grant wrote, regretting
his inability to be present:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
“I am heartily with your association in sympathy,
with any movement to honor one who was as prominent
in the early history of our country as Miles Standish;
but my engagements are such that I regret I
am unable to promise to be present in August.”</p>

<p>In the reply from General Hooker to an invitation
to attend the celebration, he writes:</p>

<p>“I regret to state that my engagements for the
month of August are such as to render it impossible
for me to join you on that memorable occasion. It is
unnecessary for me to say that I deeply sympathize
with the object of your meeting. I have been an admirer
of the character of Myles Standish from my
boyhood up, and would like to be identified with any
body of gentlemen engaged in commemorating his
great virtues. To me, his civil and military character
towers far above his contemporaries, and they, if I
mistake not (when history shall be truthfully written),
will be made to appear to be the most remarkable
body of men that ever lived. Viewed from our present
standpoint, in my opinion, they are now entitled
to that judgment. It will be a graceful act on the
part of our friends, to erect a monument to his memory;
but it must not be expected to add to his fame
or immortality. Industry, valor, and integrity were
regarded as the cardinal virtues of our forefathers,
and I hope they will never be held in less estimation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
by their descendants. One of our gifted poets has
happily named ‘Plymouth Rock’ as the corner-stone
of the nation. The superstructure promises to be
worthy of the foundation. With great respect, I have
the honor to be your friend and servant,</p>

</p>

<p>Replies of a similar character were returned by
Generals Sherman, Sheridan and Burnside, and by
W. C. Bryant. General Horace Binney Sargent delivered
the oration on this occasion. It was very eloquent
in its truthful delineation of the character and
career of the illustrious Puritan Captain. Every
reader will peruse with interest the following graphic
sketch from its pages:</p>

<p>“About the time that all Christendom was in
mourning for the murdered Prince of Orange, and deploring
in his death the overthrow of the bulwark of
the Protestant faith, a little fair-haired child was playing
among the hedge-rows of England, who was destined
to learn the art of war in the armies of that
king’s more warlike son, Prince Maurice, then a boy
of seventeen, and to be a tower of defence to the unsoldierly
Pilgrim colony of Protestant America.</p>

<p>“That child—whose bones, after nearly fourscore
years of toil and war, were laid somewhere on this
hill-side, perhaps under our unconscious feet—was
Myles Standish, the great Puritan Captain! He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
born about the year 1580, of English ancestry, dating
back to rank and opulence as far as the thirteenth
century. Of his childhood, little is known. To defeat
the title of his line to lands in England, the rent-roll
of which is half a million per annum, the hand
of fraud is supposed to have defaced the page that
contained the parish record of his birth.</p>

<p>“Unjustly deprived of these vast estates, as he
avers in his will, in which he bequeaths his title to his
eldest son, it seems probable that he went to Holland
near the time of his majority. Queen Elizabeth
signed his commission as lieutenant in the English
forces, serving in the Netherlands against the cruel
armies of the Inquisition. As she died in 1603,
about two years after his majority, it is not improbable
that we are indebted to that first disappointment,
which may have driven him, in his early manhood and
some despair, into the army.</p>

<p>“From 1600 to 1609, the year of the great truce
between Prince Maurice and the King of Spain, the
contest was peculiarly obstinate and bloody. In this
fierce school the Puritan captain learned the temper
and art of war.</p>

<p>“From 1609 to 1620, a period of truce but not of
civil tranquility, the Low Countries were inflamed
by those theological disputes of the Calvinists and
Arminians which brought the excellent Barneveldt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
to the scaffold, and drove the great Grotius—a fugitive
from prison—into exile. In this school, perhaps,
Myles Standish learned some uncompromising religious
opinions, which brought him into strange sympathy
and connection with the Pilgrim church in Leyden.
Both periods seemed to leave their impress on
his character. The inventory, recorded with his will,
mentions the Commentaries of Cæsar, Bariffe’s Artillery,
three old Bibles, and three muskets, with the
harness of the time, complete. His Bibles were old.
A well-worn Bible for every musket; and, thank God,
a musket, not an old one, to defend each Bible!</p>

<p>“The schedule of his books, some forty in number,
records nearly twenty which are devotional or religious.
With the memory of one act of singularly
resolute daring, when, in obedience to the colonial
orders to crush a great Indian conspiracy, he took a
squad of eight picked men into the forests, and
deemed it prudent to kill the most turbulent warrior
with his own hands, we may imagine how the Pilgrim
soldier, friend and associate of Brewster, disciple of
the saintly Robinson, rose from the perusal of one
of the old Bibles, or of “Ball on Faith,” “Spasles
against Heresie,” or “Dodd on the Lord’s Supper,”
to stab Pecksuot to the heart with his own knife; a
giant who had taunted him with his small stature, in
almost the very words of Goliah in his insulting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
sneer at David, long before; and to cut off the head
of Watawamat, which bloody trophy the elders had
ordered him to bring home with him. We can imagine
him on the evening of that cheaply victorious
day, taking more than usual pleasure in the exultant
psalms of the warrior David, and in a chapter of Burrough’s
“Christian Contentement” and “Gospell Conversation,”
especially as he had his three muskets
with bandoleers, and Bariffe’s Artillery, close at his
hand. One can feel the unction with which the valorous
Pilgrim would religiously fulfil the colonial
order to smite the heathen hip and thigh, and hew
Agag in pieces before the Lord.</p>

<p>“Not originally, and perhaps never, a member of
the Pilgrim church, and possessing many traits which
might have belonged to the fierce trooper, in an army
whose cavalry was the legitimate descendant of
Cæsar’s most formidable enemies,—the Batavi, celebrated
for cavalry qualities, and long the body-guard
of the Roman emperors,—the appearance of the
somewhat violent soldier, in the saintly company of
Parson Robinson’s church, is an anomaly.</p>

<p>“It has been proven many a time, from the days of
Bannockburn, when the Scottish host sank on its
knees to receive the benediction of the Black Abbot
of Inchaffray, even to our own late day, when many
of the best fighting regiments were blessed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
most earnest chaplains, that men never tender their
lives more gallantly to God and mother-land than
when they are fervently preached to and prayed for.</p>

<p>“Yet the all-daring contempt for peril, the roughness
of temper, the masterly economy with which
Standish saved human life by consumate indifference
to personal homicide upon prudent occasion, his power
of breathing his own fiery heart into a handful of
followers, till he made them an army able to withstand
a host in the narrow gates of death, would lead us to
expect such a colleague for the saintly Brewster as
little as we should expect to see <span class="locked">Sheridan—</span></p>

</div>

<p class="in0">prominent among the Methodists.</p>

<p>“In truth, with the poem of our sweetest and most
cultured bard in our minds, and with the memory of
those fierce monosyllables with which our great cavalry
leader rolled back defeat upon the jubilant rebel
host, and rescued victory at Winchester, fancy can
depict the foaming black horse pressed into the rush
of the shell-shattered guidons by the iron gripe of
knees booted in “Cordovan leather,” and imagine that
little Myles Standish rode that day in the saddle of
little Phil. Sheridan.</p>

<p>“To the genealogist, who believes that names represent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
qualities and things, it is not unpleasing to find
in the family record of Standish and Duxbury Hall,
in the parish church of Chorley, Old England, the
name Milo Standanaught. To stand at nothing, in
the way of a duty commanded by the civil authority,
seemed the essence of character in Myles Standish;
and thoroughness stamps the reputation of the name
and blood to-day.</p>

<p>“The materials for personal biography are scanty.
His wife, Rose Standish,—an English rose,—whose
very name augurs unfitness for a New England winter
on an unsettled cape, died within a month of the
landing. A light tradition exists that his second wife,
Barbara, was her sister, whom he left an orphan child
in England, and sent for. She arrived a woman
grown, and the valorous captain added another illustration
to the poet’s story, that Venus and the forger
of thunderbolts were married.</p>

<p>“From the first anchorage, Captain Standish, as
the soldier of the company, was charged with all deeds
of adventure. At first, certain grave elders were
sent with him for counsel. But ultimately his repute
in affairs, both civil and military, was such that he was
for many years the treasurer of the colony, and, during
a period of difficulty, their agent in England. As
a soldier, he was evidently the Von Moltke of the
Pilgrims. They invested him with the general command.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
Even in extreme old age—the very year that
he died “very auncient and full of dolorous paines”—he
received his last and fullest commission against
new enemies, his old friends, the Dutch.</p>

<p>“It is singular that among the primitive people,
who must often in the later Indian wars have missed
his counsel and conduct, as the poet describing
Venice, <span class="locked">sighs,—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“‘Oh! for one hour of blind old Dandole.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">no clear tradition has descended of the place where
the war-worn bones of the soldier-pilgrim lie. Sent,
like Moses, to guide and guard a feeble people to a
promised land of power that he might never see, no
man knoweth his burial-place until this day.</p>

<p>“More than one hundred years ago, the following
paragraph appeared in the Boston “News-Letter,”
dated Boston, January 22, 1770: “We hear from
Plymouth that the 22d day of December last was there
observed by a number of gentlemen, by the name of
the Old Colony Club, in commemoration of the landing
of their ancestors in that place.”</p>

<p>“The fourth toast on that occasion, a hundred and
one years ago, was, “To the memory of that brave
man and good officer, Capt. Miles Standish.”</p>

<p>“Over the graves of the guests at that <span class="locked">dinner,—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="iq">“‘For fifty years the grasses have been growing.’<br /></span>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
But the principle of public fidelity shares the immortality
of God and Truth. Reverence for it never dies
till the decay of nations. And to-day we come together,
the dwellers in the city and the dwellers on
the shore, men of every age and all professions, to
dedicate one spot of this parental soil for an enduring
monument to the same Myles Standish of the same
unfaded record. The sunlight of near three hundred
years, that has shone fatal on many a reputation since
his baby eyes first saw the light of England, has only
brought out the lasting colors of his fame.</p>

<p>“Believing, as I firmly do, that he was a useful, a
necessary citizen, because he was ‘that brave man
and good officer’ at a time when soldierly qualities
were essential to the very life of the infant colony, it
seems to me providential for the colonists that one of
their number was, by temper and training, unable to
sympathize with that soft tenderness for human life
which is wont to characterize saintly-minded men,
like the Rev. Mr. Robinson, who, when he heard of
the marvelous conflict where Standish, with three or
four others, in a locked room, killed the same number
of hostile chiefs that were gathering their tribes to
exterminate the English, uttered these sorrowful
words: ‘Oh! that you had converted some before
you had killed any!’</p>

<p>“The soldier practised that terrible piece of economy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
which no saint of the company would have
dreamed of doing with his own hand. To borrow the
diction of the time, the gauntlet of the man of wrath
was the fold of the lambs of God. It was fortunate
for us who believe in Plymouth Rock, that one
trained soldier, who had faced war conducted by the
Duke of Alva, came out in the Mayflower.</p>

<p>“Myles Standish represented the true idea of
public service, vigorous fidelity, and trained fitness
for his place. In his single heroic person he presented
the true idea of the army,—skilled military
force in loyal subordination to the civil authority.
The confidence that the colony reposed in him to execute
their most difficult commands as a soldier, seems
to prove that he revered, in the words of Mr. Robinson’s
farewell sermon, ‘the image of the Lord’s power
and authority which the magistrate beareth.’</p>

<p>“To be the founders of states is the first of glories,
according to Lord Bacon. The career of our
Pilgrim hero is a beautiful illustration of an education
fitted to the great mission for which he seemed peculiarly,
strangely ordained.</p>

<p>“In grateful memory we consecrate this spot of
earth to a monument of the great Puritan Captain.
May its shadow fall upon his grave! For two centuries
the stars have looked upon it. At what moment
of the night the circling moon may point it out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
with shadowy finger, no mortal knows. No mortal
ear can hear the secret whispered to the night, ‘Beneath
this spot lies all of a hero that could die.’”</p>

<p>Several other eloquent addresses were made upon
the occasion by General B. F. Butler, Dr. Loring,
and other gentlemen of the highest social standing.
The community is deeply indebted to Stephen M.
Allen, Esq., one of the prominent citizens of Duxbury,
for the time and money he has devoted to
furtherance of this good enterprise. As Corresponding
Secretary of the Standish Memorial Association,
he has been one of the most efficient agents in pushing
forward the truly patriotic undertaking.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 7th of October, 1872, the corner-stone
of the Standish monument was laid. It was indeed
a gala day in the ancient town of Duxbury. It
is estimated that ten thousand people were present.
The Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, of
Boston, acted as escort to the procession. Several
Masonic Lodges, with their glittering paraphernalia
took part in the imposing ceremonies. As the long
procession wound up the slope of Captain’s Hill,
thousands of spectators lined their path on either side.
A memorial box was deposited under the corner-stone
with a metallic plate which bore the following inscription:</p>

<p>This fine shaft rises one hundred and ten feet from
its base, and is surmounted by a bronze statue of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
Captain, in full uniform, twelve feet in height, and is
said to be a truthful likeness. The diameter of the
shaft, at its base, is twenty-eight feet. The structure
is of the finest quality of Quincy granite. I will close
this brief narrative with the eloquent words of Gen.
Horace Binney Sargent:</p>

<p>“High as the shaft may tower over headland and
bay; deep as its foundation-stones may rest; brightly
as it may gleam in the rising or setting sun upon the
mariner returning in the very furrow that the keel of
the Mayflower made, the principles of common-sense,
a citizen soldier’s education for a citizen soldier’s work,
the principles of moral truth, manly honesty, prudent
energy, fidelity incorruptible, courage undauntable,
all the qualities of manhood that compel unflinching
execution of the states’ behest,—are firmer and higher
and brighter still. And to crown them all is reverence
to the Supreme Executive of Earth and
Heaven, who knows no feebleness of heart or hand,
and whose great purpose moved the war-worn Pilgrim’s
feet to seek his home upon this rock-bound
continent, where the unceasing waves of two unfettered
oceans roar the choral hymn of Freedom.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
